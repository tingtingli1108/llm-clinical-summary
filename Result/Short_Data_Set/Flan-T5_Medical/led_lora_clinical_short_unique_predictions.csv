Doctor: No, we need to do the surgery. Guest_family: Okay, what are the risks of infection with the surgery? Doctor: Historically, its less than one percent. Guest_family: How is this possible? Doctor: We use prophylactic antibiotics, this helps us control for infection the entire time. Guest_family: Will she be asleep for this? Doctor: Yes, she won't feel a thing. Guest_family: Will she need this hardware taken out in the future? Doctor: Yes, in about a year or two, after everything is healed up nicely. The other risks include bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, and hardware failure. I see good results from my surgeries so I would not worry about these things, but I must disclose. Guest_family: Okay, yes, we'd like to do the surgery.","The patient is a 13-year-old right-hand dominant girl, who fell off a swing at school around 1:30 today. The patient was initially seen at an outside facility and brought here by her father, given findings on x-ray, a closed reduction was attempted on the left elbow. After the attempted reduction, the patient was noted to have an incarcerated medial epicondyle fracture as well as increasing ulnar paresthesias that were not present prior to the procedure. Given this finding, the patient needed urgent open reduction and internal fixation to relieve the pressure on the ulnar nerve. At that same time, the patient's mildly angulated radial shaft fracture will be reduced. This was explained to the father. The risks of surgery included the risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, need for later hardware removal, and possible continuous nerve symptoms. All questions were answered. The father agreed to the above plan.","The patient fell off the swing at school. She had an incarcerated medial epicondyle fracture and a mildly angulated radial shaft fracture. The patient had an attempt to do a reduction of the medial epi cond yle fracture, which was unsuccessful. She also had an attempted reduction of her radial shaft, which failed. She did not have a fracture of the ulnar nerve, and she had a moderate angulated fracture of her left radial shaft. She has a mildly incarcerated medial episodic epidermis fracture, and the patient has an attempt of a radial shaft reduction, which did not occur. She is currently in an Urgent Care, where she had an x ray of her arm. The x rays show that she has a moderate medial epidermolysis bullosa fracture, as well as a fracture in the radial shaft of the radial axis. The fracture is located in the inside part of the elbow, and it is believed to be caused by the attempt of the reduction. The injury is located at the inside of the left elbow. The break is located on the inside portion of the right elbow. It is believed that the patient is in pain, and there is a lot of pressure on the radial nerve, which is causing the pain and tingling. The pain is very intense, and this is new to the patient. She does not have any other symptoms. She was in the ER at the time of the incident, and did not see any other patients. She will be referred to an orthopedic surgeon for further evaluation and evaluation. The surgery will be performed by an orthopaedic surgeon, who is a resident of the same hospital. He will perform an O R I F procedure, which will involve the removal of the broken radial shaft and the insertion of pins in order to stabilize the break, and we can start the healing process. I will also place pins in the elbow. I'll also place a pin in her left elbow to stabilize it, and I will place a metal rod in the arm, to help stabilize the fracture and to prevent further infection. The surgeon will remove the hardware from the left arm, and he will place the pins in her elbow. He is not aware of any other injuries. He has no history of trauma to the arm. He does not know the patient's history, and has not had any previous history of fractures in this arm. There is no evidence of any previous trauma to this area. He believes that this injury is not related to previous trauma. The"

Given his tightness, surgery versus observation was recommended to the family. Family however wanted to correct his toe walking. Surgery was then discussed. Risks of surgery include risks of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremities, failure to resolve toe walking, possible stiffness, cast, and cast problems. All questions were answered and parents agreed to above surgical plan.","The patient is toe walking with a crouched pattern. The patient has been using a walker since he started walking. He has had surgery on the back of his leg to correct the tightness of the hamstring. The surgery is to correct this tightness. The risks include anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and the motion of walking, and it may also not always cure the toe walking. It is worth it because the chances of the risks happening are low. There is also possible stiffness after wearing the cast and other cast issues. He will be under anesthesia during the procedure. The risk of infection is very low, and the patient will not be under anesthetic during the surgery.

He does not have any other issues with the leg, and he has not had any problems with the hip, hamstring, or back of the legs being tight. He is not toe walking, however, he does have some tightness in the hamstrings. He should have surgery on this leg, as well, to correct that tightness and the hip. He may have to have the surgery on both legs. The procedure may not cure all of the problems, but it is worth the risk of the pain. It may also be worth it for the patient to have surgery. There are also possible complications with the cast, including infection and other issues. It will not cure the pain, and there is also some stiffness after the cast. There may be some changes in the sensation of his legs, and both sides flex to only about twenty. This is the popliteal angle. The hip is tight, the hamstring tightness is very tight.

Doctor: Oh no, how long has this knee been hurting you? Patient: Well, since the fall of two thousand seven. Doctor: Have you seen another doctor for this? Patient: Mom, can you tell the doctor? Guest_family: Yes, actually, we went to another orthopedist in November of two thousand seven. Doctor: I see, and what did this doctor recommend? Guest_family: We got an MRI, I have a disc with the images, and the report as well right here, if you want to take a look at it. Doctor: Thank you, yes, so this shows left patellar chondromalacia. Has she been to P T? Guest_family: We got a referral for P T, but they only wanted to do, um, let me look at my notes, patellar tracking exercises. Doctor: I see, has she been wearing her brace? Guest_family: Yes, she has been. I've been making sure of it. Doctor: That's good, and how is your pain today, dear? Patient: P T only made the pain much worse, it hurts so much. Guest_family: Yes, she's in a lot of pain, is there anything else we can do, besides P T? Doctor: Well, we're in a pretty difficult spot here. The majority of my patients get significantly better by just going to P T. Guest_family: Is there any surgery to fix this? Doctor: Usually, we manage this for six months without surgery, and she hasn't reached that milestone yet. But, because her pain is getting so severe, I can do a lateral capsular release on this knee. Guest_family: What is that? Doctor: It's a small procedure, minimally invasive, and we can do it outpatient. Her kneecap is partially dislocating, so this surgery will get everything back into alignment. Guest_family: Okay, what is the risk of infection? Doctor: The risk of infection is actually less than one percent. We use antibiotics to control for infection. Patient: Will I be asleep for this? Doctor: Yes, you won't feel a thing. Patient: Will I need to go back to P T? Doctor: Yes, you'll need to go some after the surgery to make sure everything heals up okay. The other risks include bleeding, changes in sensation and motion extremity, failure of procedure to relieve pain, need for postoperative rehab, and significant postoperative swelling.

It was explained to the mother in detail that this is a difficult problem to treat although majority of the patients get better with physical therapy. Her failure with nonoperative treatment is below the standard 6-month trial; however, given her symptoms and severe pain, lateral capsular release was offered. Risk and benefits of surgery were discussed. Risks of surgery including risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion extremity, failure of procedure to relieve pain, need for postoperative rehab, and significant postoperative swelling. All questions were answered, and mother and daughter agreed to the above plans.","The patient has a left patellar chondromalacia. She has been wearing a brace for six months.

She did not go to P T at this time, however, she has had P T in the past six months, and has not had any improvement in her pain.

Her kneecap is partially dislocating. The knee is partially dislocated, and the knee has been in a state of partial dislocation. This has caused the patient to wear a brace, which has made the pain much worse. The pain has been very severe, but the patient has not received any P T since the fall of two years ago. This is the first time that she has gone to a doctor for this. She had a P T referral for this, but they only wanted to do, um, let me look at my notes for P T and did not recommend it. They did not do a lateral capular release for this patient. They only did a lateral P T on this patient, which she did not have P T or P T prior to this visit. They have been doing a lateral patellareal release. This patient is in very severe pain, but has not gone to the P T clinic. She wants to do the surgery. The risk of infection is very low.

"Doctor: Hello, miss. What brings you into our clinic today? Also, before we start, it looks like you forgot to fill out your ethnicity on the new patient paperwork. Do you mind telling me what you identify as? Patient: Hello, doctor. I am white and I am a young sixty two years old. I have a list of issues I would like to talk about. Doctor: Let's begin. I know that you have been dealing with hypertension and lipometabolism disorder. Doctor X Y Z and I follow you on the hypertension. What else do we have going on? Patient: First off I have a history of diabetes in my family. My father had it and my brother has it currently. I am afraid because I know I have gained some weight. My knee also has been hurting for a long time. The left knee. Doctor: Can you locate where the pain is? Patient: I think it is everywhere in the knee. It hurts to kneel. I had imaging done on it a while ago. Can you check to see the results? Doctor: Ah, yes. We have on file that you had an X Ray done in nineteen ninety nine. I see that a joint is narrowing. We can talk about possible surgery. Patient: Can I have it x rayed again? I don't want any surgery, but I want to know what is going on. I am afraid of surgery. Doctor: Let's see what else I can do. Any other issues? Patient: Yes. I am very concerned because my poop is baby yellow and I have some rectal bleeding occasionally. It is always bright red and drips into the toilet. My last colonoscopy was in nineteen ninety nine. Doctor: Do you have any history of colon cancer? Patient: I do not, but I think my mother did. She is gone now, so I cannot check. Do you think my poop is baby yellow because of my stomach pain? I have some stomach pain and have been laying off the fast food and soda, but it doesn't seem to work. Sometimes my poop is hard or runny. It is always random. Doctor: Do you bleed when the stool is hard? Patient: Not really. Oh, and lastly, I had cold symptoms. Like a sore throat and I was sneezing a lot. I think it was a cold or flu because Claritin did not work. I think the body aches were also from this illness. I feel okay today, but I wanted to bring this up just in case it had to do with my stool being discolored. During this sick period I also am wondering if I have sleep apnea because I wake up in the middle of the night randomly. Doctor: Do you snore? That is a sign of sleep apnea. Smoking also can contribute to restlessness. Patient: No I do not snore and I do not smoke.","The patient is a 62-year-old white female with multiple chronic problems including hypertension and a lipometabolism disorder. She follows with Dr. XYZ on her hypertension, as well as myself. She continues to gain weight. Diabetes is therefore a major concern. In fact, her dad had diabetes and she has a brother who has diabetes. The patient also has several additional concerns she brings up today. One is that her left knee continues to bother her and it hurts. She cannot really isolate where the pain is, it just seems to hurt through her knee. She has had this for some time now and in fact as we reviewed her records, her left knee has been x-rayed in 1999. There was some minimal narrowing of the weightbearing joint with some minor hypertrophic spurring medially. She would like to have this x-rayed again today. She is certainly not interested in any surgery. She has noted that it particularly hurts to kneel. In addition, she complains of her stools being a baby-yellow. She has rectal bleeding off and on. It is bright red. She had a colonoscopy done in 1999. She does have a family history of colon cancer questionable in her mother, who is deceased. She complains of some diffuse abdominal pain off and on. She has given up fast foods and her pop and this has not seemed to help. She does admit however, that she is not eating right. Sometimes her stools are hard. Sometimes they are runny. The blood does not really seem to be related to necessarily a hard stool. It is always bright red and will sometimes drip into the toilet. Over the last couple of days, she had also been sneezing and has had an itchy throat. She tried some Claritin and this did not help. She has had some body aches. She is finally feeling better today with this. She also is questioning whether she has some sleep apnea. She will awaken suddenly in the middle of the night. She was told that she does snore. She does not smoke. As stated, she has gained significant weight.","The patient has a history of diabetes and lipometabolism disorder in her family.

She says she has had some rectal bleeding occasionally. She thinks it is due to the stool being discolored. She did not have a colonoscopy. She said she had one in nineteen nine. She was afraid of the possibility of colon cancer. She thought it was due to her weight gain. She wanted to know what she could do to prevent it. She feels that she is afraid she will have to have surgery. We can talk about possible surgery. There is no history of colorectal cancer. The left knee is narrowing and she has been having pain in the knee for a while. It has been bothering her for a few years. She doesn't want to do any surgery, but wants to know if she can have it X-rayed again. We have on file that you had an MRI and X-Rayed. Can you check to see the results. It shows that it is narrowing in the left knee. It was done in the nineteen ninety-nine. It does not appear to be narrowing, but she does have some pain. She would like to know more about the pain and what is going on with the knee. We will discuss this with her. We do not have any history of any other issues with her other than the hypertension. Any other issues? Patient: Yes. I do not smoke. I feel okay today, but I wanted to bring this up just in case it had to have something to do with my stool.

"Doctor: I hear someone has a birthday coming up, how old are you turning, ma'am? Patient: I'll be ninety later this month, doctor. Doctor: You're here for a follow up not very long after your first visit. What seems to be the problem today? Patient: Well, actually, my high blood pressure and right arm symptoms are basically gone. Doctor: Great, I saw your blood pressure reading for today, and it's much better. Are you taking the higher dose of Mavik we recommended? Patient: No, I'm not taking that right now. Doctor: How did you tolerate the higher dose? Patient: I didn't feel well at all, so I just went back to the old dose. Doctor: That was one M G per day, correct? Patient: Yes, doctor. I do think I could have some white coat high blood pressure. Doctors' offices make me nervous. Doctor: That does happen. Here, try this sample of Tarka, please. Patient: What is this for, doctor? Doctor: Well, since you're taking the Mavik plus verapamil, you can switch over to Tarka, which is the combined version of the two drugs. Patient: I can't take these, doctor. They're too big. Guest_family: Hello doctor, I'm her daughter. Just so you know, we check her blood pressure at home periodically and it's always similar to that reading. Doctor: Good, so back to that right arm, how is that doing today? Patient: Well, that pain is basically gone now, I think it had to do with that muscle problem back in my right shoulder blade. Doctor: Did you have x rays taken today? Patient: Yes, the tech brought me back right before you came in. Doctor: Good, I have the images right here. Patient: What do they show, doctor? Doctor: Well, these x rays of the neck and right shoulder show some degenerative changes, and possibly some kind of rotator cuff injury. Patient: What makes you think there's an injury? Doctor: Well, look right here. The humeral head is pretty high in the glenoid in the right shoulder, but do you have any pain here? Patient: No, none. Doctor: Then we won't worry about it. Patient: I am having this stomach pain though, doctor. Doctor: How has this pain developed and progressed recently? Patient: Well, it's improved somewhat with me not taking Aleve anymore. Doctor: What medicines are you taking right now, then? Patient: Right know, I'm just taking Tylenol as needed. That seems to be enough for me. Doctor: Do you think this could be acid reflux, or heartburn? Patient: No, but I take Tums, um, three times a day, and Mylanta at night. Oh yeah, I have these sores in my mouth, can you take a look? Doctor: I see. How long have you worn dentures? Patient: Oh I couldn't even tell you, it's been many, many years. Doctor: Do they come and go, the sores? Patient: Yes, one will come, then it'll heal up, then another. Doctor: Okay, we'll keep an eye on it. Patient: And doctor, since I've been taking the Lexapro, I have some tremors on basically my whole body, at least the upper body, like my torso and arms. Doctor: It's hard to tell if you have a tremor today, ma'am, but do you think the Lexapro is helping otherwise? Patient: Yes, we think so.","The patient is an 89-year-old lady. She actually turns 90 later this month, seen today for a short-term followup. Actually, the main reasons we are seeing her back so soon which are elevated blood pressure and her right arm symptoms are basically resolved. Blood pressure is better even though she is not currently on the higher dose Mavik likely recommended. She apparently did not feel well with the higher dose, so she just went back to her previous dose of 1 mg daily. She thinks, she also has an element of office hypertension. Also, since she is on Mavik plus verapamil, she could switch over to the combined drug Tarka. However, when we gave her samples of that she thought they were too big for her to swallow. Basically, she is just back on her previous blood pressure regimen. However, her blood pressure seems to be better today. Her daughter says that they do check it periodically and it is similar to today's reading. Her right arm symptoms are basically resolved and she attributed that to her muscle problem back in the right shoulder blade. We did do a C-spine and right shoulder x-ray and those just mainly showed some degenerative changes and possibly some rotator cuff injury with the humeral head quite high up in the glenoid in the right shoulder, but this does not seem to cause her any problems. She has some vague 'stomach problems', although apparently it is improved when she stopped Aleve and she does not have any more aches or pains off Aleve. She takes Tylenol p.r.n., which seems to be enough for her. She does not think she has any acid reflux symptoms or heartburn. She does take Tums t.i.d. and also Mylanta at night. She has had dentures for many, many years and just recently I guess in the last few months, although she was somewhat vague on this, she has had some sores in her mouth. They do heal up, but then she will get another one. She also thinks since she has been on the Lexapro, she has somewhat of a tremor of her basically whole body at least upper body including the torso and arms and had all of the daughters who I not noticed to speak of and it is certainly difficult to tell her today that she has much tremor. They do think the Lexapro has helped to some extent.","Dentures. Patient: I can't take these, doctor. They're too big. Doctor: What medicines are you taking right now, then? Patient: Right know, I'm just taking Tylenol as needed. That seems to be enough for me. I do think I could have some white coat high blood pressure. I've been taking Mavik plus verapamil, but I'm not taking that right now. I'm also taking Tarka, which is the combined version of the two drugs, and I'm taking Tums, um, three times a day, and Mylanta at night. I don't think I have any stomach pain. I think it had to do with that muscle problem back in my right shoulder blade. The humeral head is pretty high in the glenoid in the right shoulder, but do you have any pain here.

"Doctor: Hello, ma'am. What is the reason for your visit today? Patient: I was referred by a doctor to come see you so that you could check up on my nasal problems. Here is my report from my previous doctor who referred me to you. Doctor: Thank you. Let me take a look. I see here it says you had severe sinusitis two to three months ago, correct? Patient: Is that what they're calling my nasal problems? Doctor: Yeah, it is. Sinusitis is the inflammation of your nasal airways. Patient: I see. Thank you for describing it to me. Doctor: No problem. Would you be able to describe to me what you had been feeling two to three months ago? Patient: Yeah, I can. My face would feel uncomfortable, my nose was stuffy, my eyes hurt, and I felt something dropping in the back of my throat. Doctor: Have you ever been prescribed any medication? Patient: Here's the list of medicine I was taking. Doctor: I see you were given antibiotics, correct? Patient: I was, but I don't know what those are. Could you explain them to me? Doctor: Antibiotics are usually used to fight infections. Patient: I had an infection? I thought I just had some nasal problems. Doctor: Your report states you had a severe infection. Do you remember if the antibiotics helped? Patient: Not really. I felt like my symptoms were the same. Doctor: I see. Did your doctor order any advanced imaging's? Patient: Yeah. They did a C T scan of my nose. Here is the report from my C T scan. Doctor: Let me take a look. It looks like you had some thickening of the mucosal layer in your right paranasal sinus. You also had some obstruction in your right ostiomeatal complex and excess growing of some of the bones in your nose. Uhm. Oh, one more thing. I see your nasal septum was shifted to the left. Patient: Oh, wow. Thank you for explaining everything to me. Doctor: No problem. Going back to your list of medications, I know you took antibiotics for your infection, but did you take any medication for your sinuses? Patient: No, I haven't. I did try this cream for my nose, but that didn't work either. Nothing worked! Doctor: I see. Looks like the cream you used was a topical nasal corticosteroid. Are there any other symptoms that you have been experiencing? Patient: I've had some trouble with my balance, and I feel like I've lost some of my hearing. I thought this was odd since I'm only fifty years old. I think my ears felt plugged or full of air, so they just needed to pop. Doctor: I see. Let's perform an audiogram test to check your ears. Patient: Sounds good. Doctor: I'm seeing that you have some mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Your tympanometry seems to be normal. Your speech discrimination was also normal. Patient: That's reassuring. Doctor: I want to ask a few more questions about your ears. Do you feel any fullness or pressure? Patient: No, I don't feel anything like that right now. Doctor: Do you hear any humming, buzzing, or roaring sounds? Patient: Nope. I don't hear anything like that. Doctor: We checked your ears and now understand more about the problem, but I wonder why your balance is affected. When did you start noticing your balance was affected? Patient: I think it could have been to this one medicine that starts with an A. I forgot the name, but it didn't really help my nasal problems. It just made my balance worse. Doctor: Was the medicine called Allegra? Patient: Oh, yeah. That's what it was called. I thought I had some sort of allergy, so I thought it would help. Doctor: I see. Did you ever feel any dizziness too? Patient: Yeah, I did. Doctor: I will have you do some movements to see if your dizziness occurs. Patient: Sounds good. Doctor: Could you look to the left and then look to the right. Patient: Oh, wow. That made me very dizzy. Doctor: Looks like sudden movements and head turning make your dizziness worse.","I had the pleasure of meeting and evaluating the patient referred today for evaluation and treatment of chronic sinusitis.

She currently is not taking any medication for her sinuses. She also has noted that she is having some problems with her balance and possible hearing loss or at least ear popping and fullness. Her audiogram today demonstrated mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss, normal tympanometry, and normal speech discrimination. She has tried topical nasal corticosteroid therapy without much improvement. She tried Allegra without much improvement and she believes the Allegra may have caused problems with balance to worsen.
