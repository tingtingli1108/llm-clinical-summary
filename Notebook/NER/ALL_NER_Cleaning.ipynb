We took her to ABC Medical Center, where they ran some tests and sent us here. doctor: I see. Well, I'm going to examine you now and then we'll talk about the next steps. doctor: (examines the patient) doctor: Okay, I've reviewed your medical history and your test results from ABC Medical Center. It seems like you have a urinary tract infection, which is causing some of your symptoms. We're going to start you on antibiotics to treat that. doctor: I'm also concerned about the weakness on your right side and the difficulty speaking. These symptoms could be caused by a stroke or a transient ischemic attack (TIA). We're going to order an MRI, an ultrasound of your carotids, and an echocardiogram to get a better look at your brain and your heart. doctor: In the meantime, we're going to give you some fluids to help with your dehydration and we're going to start you on antiplatelet therapy to help prevent further strokes. doctor: We're also going to check your blood sugar levels and adjust your diabetes medication as needed. doctor: I've also ordered a urine culture to see what kind of bacteria is causing your urinary tract infection. Once we have the results, we can adjust your antibiotics if necessary. doctor: I'm going to ask a neurologist to come and see you to help us figure out what's causing your weakness and difficulty speaking. patient: (nods) daughter: Thank you, doctor. We appreciate your help. doctor: You're welcome. I'll be back in a little while to check on you.\",\n          \"Doctor: Hello Patient, I'm Dr. Doctor, your physician.

Patient: I had an abnormal Pap smear in the 80s, but I didn't follow up on it until this year. A biopsy showed microinvasive carcinoma of the cervix, and I had a cone biopsy on February 12th, which also showed microinvasive carcinoma with a 1 mm invasion. Doctor: I see. So, you elected to have a total vaginal hysterectomy as definitive therapy? Patient: Yes, that's right. I'm aware that I'll need to continue having Pap smears in the future. Doctor: That's good to hear. I'm glad you're taking your health seriously. Now, let's talk about your surgery. How have you been feeling since the procedure? Patient: I've been doing really well. My bowel and bladder function returned quickly, and I'm ambulating well and tolerating a regular diet. Doctor: That's great news. I'm glad to hear that you're recovering so well. I did review your medical records and noted that you had an incidental cystotomy during the surgery. Patient: Yes, that's right. But I understand that it was repaired intraoperatively without any difficulty. Doctor: Correct. And your final pathology report came back free of residual disease, which is excellent news. Patient: I'm so relieved to hear that. Doctor: Me too. Now, let's talk about your discharge instructions. You'll need to take Vicodin, Motrin, and Macrodantin at bedtime for urinary tract infection suppression. Patient: Okay, I'll make sure to do that. Doctor: And you'll need to follow up with me in ten days for a cystogram and catheter removal. We'll also discuss your office follow-up at that time. Patient: I'll be sure to come in for my follow-up appointment. Doctor: Good. I'm glad we were able to get this all taken care of. If you have any questions or concerns in the meantime, please don't hesitate to call my office. Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help.\",\n          \"doctor: Good morning, patient.

I've been alternating between constipation and diarrhea for the past several years. I also get some lower abdominal cramping and discomfort, especially when I'm constipated. doctor: Do you take any medications for these problems? patient: Yes, I take a lot of medications. I take Tramadol, hydrocodone, zolpidem, triamterene, atenolol, vitamin D, TriCor, simvastatin, ibuprofen, and Lyrica. doctor: I see. Well, I think we need to do some tests to figure out what's causing your problems. I'd like to order an upper endoscopy and a colonoscopy. patient: What are those? doctor: An upper endoscopy is a procedure where we insert a thin tube with a camera on the end down your throat to look at your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. A colonoscopy is a procedure where we insert a thin tube with a camera on the end into your rectum to look at your colon. patient: Okay. And what if they find something? doctor: If we find anything abnormal, we can take a biopsy to test it. patient: I see. Well, I guess I'll do it. doctor: Okay. I'll also prescribe some medications to help with your heartburn and indigestion. patient: Thank you. doctor: You're welcome. I'll see you back in a few weeks to go over the results of your tests. patient: Okay.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"note\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1102,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Weakness on right side and difficulty speaking.

Thank you for coming in today. I understand you've been experiencing some confusion and had a stroke. patient: Yes, that's right. I'm not sure why I'm here, but I had a stroke. doctor: I see. Well, let's start by going over your medical history. You have a history of coronary artery disease and had bypass grafting surgery in the past. Do you remember when and where that was? patient: I'm not sure. I don't remember much about it. doctor: That's okay. We can look that up in your chart. It also says here that you have carotid artery stenosis and had right carotid artery stenting. Again, do you recall when that was? patient: No, I don't remember that either. doctor: No problem. Additionally, you have diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a history of stroke with left-sided hemiplegia. patient: Yes, I remember having a stroke. doctor: I understand. Now, let's talk about your current symptoms. You mentioned confusion. Can you tell me more about that? patient: Well, I've been feeling disoriented and forgetful. I also had trouble speaking and understanding others. doctor: I see. And have you experienced any chest discomfort, shortness of breath, or palpitations? patient: No, I haven't had any of those symptoms. doctor: That's good to hear. I've reviewed your EKG and telemetry results. It shows that you have atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. However, your current telemetry shows normal sinus rhythm. patient: What does that mean? doctor: Atrial fibrillation is a heart rhythm disorder where the upper chambers of your heart (the atria) beat irregularly and rapidly. This can lead to a rapid heart rate and an increased risk of stroke. patient: That sounds serious. doctor: It can be, but we're going to take steps to manage it. I've consulted with cardiology, and we recommend starting you on Coumadin to prevent further strokes. However, given your current neurological status, we need to assess your risk of falling. If the risk is low, we'll proceed with Coumadin. Otherwise, we'll consider aspirin and Plavix. patient: I understand. doctor: Additionally, you have carotid artery stenosis. We'll order a CT angio of the carotid to assess stent patency. However, given your recent stroke, revascularization is not indicated at this time. patient: Okay. doctor: Finally, you have coronary artery disease, but you're clinically stable. We'll monitor that closely. patient: Thank you for explaining everything to me. doctor: You're welcome. We'll continue to monitor your condition and make any necessary adjustments to your treatment plan.\",\n          \"doctor: Hello, patient. I understand you're here today for foot pain? patient: Yes, that's right. I've been having pain in my foot for a while now, and it's been getting worse lately. doctor: Can you tell me more about the pain? Where exactly is it located? patient: It's on the top and lateral aspect of my foot, below my ankle. It's a sharp, stabbing pain that gets worse when I walk or exercise. doctor: Have you seen a doctor about this pain before? patient: Yes, I saw Dr. XYZ last week for back pain, and he prescribed me some pain medication and muscle relaxers. But I've been in here multiple times for different kinds of pain. doctor: I see. And have you had any recent injuries to your foot? patient: No, I haven't injured it recently. It's just been chronically painful. doctor: I understand. Well, let me take a look at your foot. doctor (after examining the patient's foot): Your foot looks okay. There's no redness, swelling, or warmth. The surgical scars are well-healed. There is some mild tenderness around the medial side of your foot, just below the medial malleolus. patient: Yeah, that's where it hurts the most. doctor: I think the pain you're experiencing is likely due to the hardware in your foot. It's possible that the hardware is causing some irritation or inflammation. patient: So, what can I do about it? doctor: Well, we can try some different things to see what helps. I'm going to prescribe you some Lortab 7.5 to help with the pain. I'm also going to refer you to a specialist who can evaluate your foot and determine if the hardware needs to be removed. patient: Okay, thank you. doctor: You're welcome. I hope this helps. patient: Me too. doctor: I also want to talk to you about your primary care physician. You've been seen here multiple times for pain, and it's important to have a regular doctor who can oversee your care. patient: I know, I've been trying to find one. I was supposed to see Dr. XYZ today, but they canceled my appointment because I don't have Project Access insurance yet. doctor: I see. Well, I'm glad to hear that Project Access will be approving your insurance next week. In the meantime, I'm going to keep your chart open so that we can follow up with you and make sure you're getting the care you need. patient: Thank you, I appreciate that. doctor: You're welcome. I'm here to help.\",\n          \"doctor today i'm seeing christina cooper . her date of birth is 07/01/1954 . uh , ms. cooper is a new patient who was referred by diane nelson for a long-standing iron deficiency anemia . doctor hello , how are you ? patient i'm good , thank you . doctor so tell me what brings you in today . patient recently i tried to donate blood , around december i think , and they told me i was anemic , which is something i've been dealing with for a while , so it's not the first time i've been told i'm anemic . doctor or how have you been feeling in general with this ? patient not great . i have been feeling fatigued often during the day , and even feverish with chills at times . when i try to be active i like i ca n't catch my breath and i feel like i'm wheezing . i've had some headaches too , which is not like me . doctor okay . are there any other symptoms ? patient i've been noting some chilling sensations . i also get cold so easily . it's annoying . i feel like i have to really bundle up . i do n't know if this is related but my anxiety and depression feel like it has been getting worse lately . i feel like a mess . doctor sounds like you're not feeling great , obviously . and i'm glad you came to see us . um , we're certainly going to try to figure this out and figure out what's going on , uh , but it sounds like you've been dealing with this anemia for a long time ? patient yeah , i've been anemic since i was 13 years old . doctor right . so why do your doctors think you're anemic ? do you have a history of heavy periods ? patient well i did have heavy periods until i had a hysterectomy in 1996 . but no , they have not told me why they think i'm anemic , which is frustrating honestly . doctor yeah . i can imagine that is . um , let's see if we can help though . since you had your hysterectomy your periods , of course , are no longer the issue . um , when was your last colonoscopy ? patient about five to six years ago . doctor and was it relatively a normal exam ? did you have any polyps ? patient no . they said they'd see me in 10 years . doctor well that's good news . patient yeah , i agree . doctor um , do you have a pacemaker or defibrillator , or have sleep apnea , or use oxygen at night ? patient no . doctor all right . do you ever drink alcohol ? patient yeah , but only once or twice a year . doctor okay . are you taking any supplements such as iron or vitamin b12 ? patient i already started taking my iron pills which i have not taken in about a year . doctor all right . and what are you taking ? patient i'm taking 25 milligram tablets , twice daily . doctor okay , and that's the , the ferrous sulfate ? patient yeah , that's it . i take one in the morning and one in the evening . doctor okay . anything else ? patient yeah , i take vitamin b12 , just the over the counter stuff . doctor okay , very good . all right , well let's go ahead and take a look and see what's going on . patient sounds good . thank you . doctor of course . you'll hear me , uh , talk through your exam so that i get all the information documented . patient okay . doctor all right . so use my general physical exam template . i will start by listening to your heart and lungs . patient okay . doctor all right . next , i'd like you to lay back so i can examine your abdomen . patient okay . doctor is there any tenderness where i'm pressing ? patient no . doctor okay . you can sit up . so your physical exam is normal without any significant findings . all right ms. cooper , often when we initially see anemia and your host of symptoms , we suspect internal bleeding . patient is that why they want me to have another upper endoscopy ? doctor actually it would be an upper endoscopy and a colonoscopy , but yes , likely that's the reason why . patient lovely . doctor yeah . unfortunately our cameras do not meet all the way in the middle , so if those tests back , come , if those tests come back fine , then we'll have you swallow a pill camera to take pictures as it moves through your , uh , system . patient okay . doctor we may not need to , but it's just the first thing we can do to make sure that you're not losing blood . um , the second thing we can do is have you see a hematologist . they will tell us if you need to give any , to give you any intravenous iron , or maybe something to help your body store the iron better . patient all right . doctor so let's go ahead , get your upper endoscopy and colonoscopy scheduled . patient okay . doctor um , have you ever had any issue with sedation in the past ? patient no , i was just sleepy afterwards . doctor okay . well we will give you a bowel prep to clean out your bowels ahead of time . um , if we do these tests and they are normal , like i said , then we will consider that capsule endoscopy . patient okay . sounds like a plan . doctor all right . so after that you'll be all done and we will send you to the hematologist . additionally , i'm going to need you to start taking your iron pills with orange juice . uh , the vitamin c will help you absorb the iron better . do this for about 8-12 weeks , uh , and then we can reassess your blood work . patient okay , that sounds great . doctor all right . well i think we have our plan . on your way out , stop by and schedule your upper endoscopy and c- colonoscopy . uh , we will send a referral to dr. flores who is is the hematologist , so schedule that appointment . um , here are your instructions for the pre- uh , the bowel prep . uh , call us if you have any questions or worsening symptoms . we'll be happy to help you . patient thank you . doctor you're welcome . have a great day , have a great day ms. cooper . patient you too . doctor all right . this is christina cooper , pleasant 65 year old female who was diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia in 12-2019 , and w- and was unable to donate blood . um , her followup blood work on 01/20/20 was revealed a low hemoglobin , stable hematocrit and normal iron labs , although ferritin was low . um , she was taking ferrous sulfate , three hundred , twenty phil- 25 milligrams by mouth . i've asked her to continue each dose with vitamin c found in orange juice , for the next 12 weeks , then recheck to the cbc , iron , ferritin , b12 , and folate . um , a referral was sent to her hematologist . we will plan for an egd and a colonoscopy to assess for potential sources of anemia or gi bleed . if this is inconclusive , capsule endoscopy will be considered . thanks .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"note\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 180,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Confusion and history of stroke. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a pleasant age-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of confusion and history of stroke. The patient reports feeling disoriented and forgetful. She also had trouble speaking and understanding others. She denies chest discomfort, shortness of breath, or palpitations. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and had bypass grafting surgery in the past. She also has carotid artery stenosis and had right carotid artery stenting. Additionally, she has diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a history of stroke with left-sided hemiplegia. The patient's EKG and telemetry results show atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. However, her current telemetry shows normal sinus rhythm. The patient has carotid artery stenosis. A CT angio of the carotid will be ordered to assess stent patency. The patient will be started on Coumadin to prevent further strokes. However, given her current neurological status, the risk of falling will be assessed. If the risk is low, Coumadin will be initiated. Otherwise, aspirin and Plavix will be considered. The patient will be monitored closely for her coronary artery disease. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response Assessment: Atrial fibrillation is a heart rhythm disorder where the upper chambers of the patient's heart (the atria) beat irregularly and rapidly. This can lead to a rapid heart rate and an increased risk of stroke. The patient has a history of stroke, which is a risk factor for developing atrial fibrillation. Plan: - Will consult cardiology. - Will assess patient's risk of falling. - If risk is low, will start Coumadin. If risk is high, will consider aspirin and Plavix. 2. Carotid artery stenosis Assessment: Carotid artery stenosis is a narrowing of the carotid arteries, which are the main arteries that supply blood to the brain. This can increase the risk of stroke. The patient had right carotid artery stenting in the past, but the patency of the stent is unknown. Plan: - Will order CT angio of the carotid to assess stent patency. 3. Coronary artery disease Assessment: Coronary artery disease is a narrowing of the arteries that supply blood to the heart. This can lead to chest pain, shortness of breath, and heart attacks. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and had bypass grafting surgery in the past. He is currently clinically stable. Plan: - Will monitor the patient's condition closely. 4. Left-sided hemiplegia Assessment: Left-sided hemiplegia is a weakness or paralysis of the left side of the body. This is a result of the patient's previous stroke. Plan: - Will continue to monitor the patient's neurological status. - Will provide rehabilitation as needed. Follow-up instructions: - The patient will follow up with cardiology in 1 week.\",\n          \"SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Foot pain.

She takes over-the-counter vitamin B12 and recently started taking her iron pills again, one in the morning and one in the evening. The patient has been instructed to continue each dose with vitamin C found in orange juice for the next 12 weeks, then recheck the CBC, iron, ferritin, B12, and folate. A referral was sent to her hematologist. The plan is for an EGD and a colonoscopy to assess for potential sources of anemia or GI bleed. If this is inconclusive, capsule endoscopy will be considered. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. Iron deficiency anemia Assessment: Patient has long-standing iron deficiency anemia, with low hemoglobin and low ferritin. She has taken ferrous sulfate 25mg BID and over-the-counter vitamin B12. Plan: - Continue ferrous sulfate 25mg BID with orange juice for 8-12 weeks, then recheck CBC, iron, ferritin, B12, and folate. - Referred to hematology for further evaluation and management. - Schedule EGD and colonoscopy to assess for potential sources of anemia or GI bleed. If inconclusive, capsule endoscopy will be considered. 2. Chilling sensation, cold intolerance, fatigue, shortness of breath, headache, anxiety, and depression Assessment: Patient has a constellation of symptoms that may be related to anemia, including chilling sensation, cold intolerance, fatigue, shortness of breath, headache, anxiety, and depression. Plan: - Treat the underlying iron deficiency anemia. - Provide supportive care for symptoms as needed.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n

Thank you for coming in today.

They're different from the ones he used to have. doctor: In what way? patient: (mother speaks) They're more like tonic spells. He stiffens up and his eyes roll back. He also cries and vomits after some of them. doctor: How often are these seizures happening? patient: (mother speaks) At least multiple times a week. Sometimes he has none for a few days, but then he'll have multiple days in a row with seizures. doctor: I see. And what about his other seizures? The ones he used to have? patient: (mother speaks) He hasn't had any of those in a while. doctor: That's good to hear. Now, I'm going to need to do a physical exam. Is that okay with you? patient: (nods) doctor: (performs physical exam) doctor: Everything looks good. I'm going to admit you to the hospital for a few days so we can do a video EEG. This will help us to capture both types of seizures and figure out what's causing them. patient: (mother speaks) How long will he need to stay in the hospital? doctor: Probably at least 48 to 72 hours. He could be discharged sooner if we capture multiple events. patient: (mother speaks) Okay. doctor: We'll also need to adjust his medications. We'll continue his current dose of Zonegran and Lamictal for now. These medications are very long-acting, and discontinuing them while he's in the hospital may simply result in severe seizures after discharge. patient: (mother speaks) I understand. doctor: I know this is a lot to take in.

We'll do everything we can to get patient feeling better. patient: (mother speaks) Thank you.\",\n          \"doctor: Hello patient, how are you doing today? patient: I'm not doing too well, doctor. I've been having these episodes where my face feels like it's going to twitch. I can usually suppress it by grimacing, but it's still really annoying. doctor: I see. And how often do these episodes happen? patient: It used to be several times a day, but now it's down to maybe once a week. doctor: That's good to hear. It sounds like it's improving. patient: Yeah, a little bit. But I'm still having this weird pressure-like sensation in the right side of my head. It feels like tingling, and sometimes it feels like water is running down my hair. doctor: Interesting. And how often does that happen? patient: It's also decreased in frequency. It used to be every day, but now it's about once a week. And it usually goes away if I take some Aleve. doctor: Okay, that's helpful to know. Now, I understand you're also having some problems with sleepiness and fatigue. Can you tell me more about that? patient: Yes, I'm always tired. I have trouble falling asleep at night, even though I work from 4 pm to midnight. When I finally do fall asleep, I wake up by 9 am and can't get back to sleep. I usually only get about five or six hours of sleep a night. doctor: I see. And do you have any other symptoms, like snoring or gasping for breath at night? patient: I think I might snore, but I'm not sure. I don't remember waking up gasping for breath. doctor: Okay. Well, I've reviewed your medical history and your recent MRI results. The MRI showed a small abnormality in your right clivus and petrous carotid canal, but it's not clear what it is. It's unlikely to be related to your facial twitching or your headache. patient: That's a relief. doctor: I think the best course of action for now is to continue observing your symptoms. We can repeat the MRI in four months to see if there's any change. In the meantime, let's focus on addressing your sleep problems. patient: Okay. What can I do about that? doctor: Well, first, we need to try to get you on a more regular sleep schedule. Try going to bed later, at least 10 pm or 10:30 pm, so that you can get a full night's sleep. We can also talk about weight loss and exercise, which can also help improve sleep quality. patient: I'll try that. doctor: Great. I'm also going to recommend a sleep study to rule out obstructive sleep apnea. patient: Okay. doctor: We'll follow up in five months to see how you're doing. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen or you have any new concerns, please don't hesitate to call my office. patient: Thank you, doctor.

I've also been having some strange thoughts and beliefs. Like, I believe I can fly. And I've been acting impulsively, like trying to put my hand in the garbage disposal and climbing over the balcony. doctor: I see.

They can help to stabilize your mood and prevent these manic episodes. patient: I know, but I just don't like the way they make me feel. They make me feel tired and groggy. doctor: I understand that. But the benefits of taking your medications outweigh the risks. They can help to prevent you from harming yourself or others. patient: I guess you're right. I'll start taking them again. doctor: That's good to hear. I'm also going to prescribe you a new medication called Abilify. It can help to reduce the symptoms of mania. patient: Okay. doctor: I'm also going to recommend that you see a therapist. They can help you to learn how to manage your symptoms and cope with stress. patient: I'm not sure I want to see a therapist. doctor: I understand that. But it's important to get help. A therapist can help you to get your life back on track. patient: I'll think about it. doctor: Okay. In the meantime, I'm going to keep you here in the hospital for observation. We'll monitor your symptoms and make sure you're safe. patient: Okay. doctor: I'm also going to order some blood tests to make sure there's nothing else going on that could be causing your symptoms. patient: Okay. doctor: I'll be back to check on you later. patient: Okay. doctor: (to the nurse) Please make sure the patient takes her medications as prescribed.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a young male who presents to the clinic with his mother for evaluation of new onset tonic seizures. The patient's mother reports that he has been having seizures more frequently, at least multiple times a week, sometimes with multiple days in a row with seizures. She describes these new seizures as tonic spells, with stiffening and eye rolling, as well as crying and vomiting after some of them. The patient has not had any of his typical seizures for some time. The patient is currently taking Zonegran and Lamictal for his seizures. His mother understands that these medications will be continued at his current dose during his hospitalization. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. Complex partial seizures and new-onset tonic seizures Assessment: The patient has a history of complex partial seizures that have recently become more frequent and severe. He is also experiencing new-onset tonic seizures. These seizures are characterized by stiffening, eye rolling back, crying, and vomiting. The patient's current anticonvulsant medications are not adequately controlling his seizures. Plan: - Admit to the hospital for video EEG monitoring and medication adjustment. - Continue Zonegran and Lamictal at current doses. - Consider adding a third anticonvulsant medication, such as levetiracetam or topiramate. - Work with neurology for further management. Follow-up instructions: - The patient will be followed closely in the hospital. Once his seizures are under control, he will be discharged home with instructions to follow up with his neurologist in 1 week.\",\n          \"SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Facial twitching and headache.

Well, I'm going to examine you now and then we'll talk about the next steps. doctor: (examines the patient) doctor: Okay, I've reviewed your medical history and your test results from ABC Medical Center. It seems like you have a urinary tract infection, which is causing some of your symptoms. We're going to start you on antibiotics to treat that. doctor: I'm also concerned about the weakness on your right side and the difficulty speaking. These symptoms could be caused by a stroke or a transient ischemic attack (TIA). We're going to order an MRI, an ultrasound of your carotids, and an echocardiogram to get a better look at your brain and your heart. doctor: In the meantime, we're going to give you some fluids to help with your dehydration and we're going to start you on antiplatelet therapy to help prevent further strokes. doctor: We're also going to check your blood sugar levels and adjust your diabetes medication as needed. doctor: I've also ordered a urine culture to see what kind of bacteria is causing your urinary tract infection. Once we have the results, we can adjust your antibiotics if necessary. doctor: I'm going to ask a neurologist to come and see you to help us figure out what's causing your weakness and difficulty speaking. patient: (nods) daughter: Thank you, doctor.

I understand you're here for a follow-up visit after your recent total vaginal hysterectomy. Patient: That's right, doctor. Doctor: Can you tell me a little bit about your medical history? Patient: Well, I've had seven pregnancies, with five term deliveries. I also have a history of tobacco use. Doctor: Okay, and what brought you to the hospital this time? Patient: I had an abnormal Pap smear in the 80s, but I didn't follow up on it until this year. A biopsy showed microinvasive carcinoma of the cervix, and I had a cone biopsy on February 12th, which also showed microinvasive carcinoma with a 1 mm invasion. Doctor: I see. So, you elected to have a total vaginal hysterectomy as definitive therapy? Patient: Yes, that's right. I'm aware that I'll need to continue having Pap smears in the future. Doctor: That's good to hear. I'm glad you're taking your health seriously. Now, let's talk about your surgery. How have you been feeling since the procedure? Patient: I've been doing really well. My bowel and bladder function returned quickly, and I'm ambulating well and tolerating a regular diet. Doctor: That's great news. I'm glad to hear that you're recovering so well. I did review your medical records and noted that you had an incidental cystotomy during the surgery. Patient: Yes, that's right. But I understand that it was repaired intraoperatively without any difficulty. Doctor: Correct. And your final pathology report came back free of residual disease, which is excellent news. Patient: I'm so relieved to hear that. Doctor: Me too. Now, let's talk about your discharge instructions. You'll need to take Vicodin, Motrin, and Macrodantin at bedtime for urinary tract infection suppression. Patient: Okay, I'll make sure to do that. Doctor: And you'll need to follow up with me in ten days for a cystogram and catheter removal. We'll also discuss your office follow-up at that time. Patient: I'll be sure to come in for my follow-up appointment. Doctor: Good. I'm glad we were able to get this all taken care of. If you have any questions or concerns in the meantime, please don't hesitate to call my office. Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help.\",\n          \"doctor: Good morning, patient.

I also get nauseous and belch a lot. And I've been having trouble swallowing solids. doctor: How long have you been having these problems? patient: The heartburn and indigestion have been going on for years. The trouble swallowing started a few years ago. doctor: Have you noticed any other changes in your bowel habits? patient: Yes, I have. I've been alternating between constipation and diarrhea for the past several years. I also get some lower abdominal cramping and discomfort, especially when I'm constipated. doctor: Do you take any medications for these problems? patient: Yes, I take a lot of medications. I take Tramadol, hydrocodone, zolpidem, triamterene, atenolol, vitamin D, TriCor, simvastatin, ibuprofen, and Lyrica. doctor: I see. Well, I think we need to do some tests to figure out what's causing your problems. I'd like to order an upper endoscopy and a colonoscopy. patient: What are those? doctor: An upper endoscopy is a procedure where we insert a thin tube with a camera on the end down your throat to look at your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. A colonoscopy is a procedure where we insert a thin tube with a camera on the end into your rectum to look at your colon. patient: Okay. And what if they find something? doctor: If we find anything abnormal, we can take a biopsy to test it. patient: I see. Well, I guess I'll do it. doctor: Okay. I'll also prescribe some medications to help with your heartburn and indigestion. patient: Thank you. doctor: You're welcome.

They're different from the ones he used to have. doctor: In what way? patient: (mother speaks) They're more like tonic spells. He stiffens up and his eyes roll back. He also cries and vomits after some of them. doctor: How often are these seizures happening? patient: (mother speaks) At least multiple times a week. Sometimes he has none for a few days, but then he'll have multiple days in a row with seizures. doctor: I see. And what about his other seizures? The ones he used to have? patient: (mother speaks) He hasn't had any of those in a while. doctor: That's good to hear. Now, I'm going to need to do a physical exam. Is that okay with you? patient: (nods) doctor: (performs physical exam) doctor: Everything looks good. I'm going to admit you to the hospital for a few days so we can do a video EEG. This will help us to capture both types of seizures and figure out what's causing them. patient: (mother speaks) How long will he need to stay in the hospital? doctor: Probably at least 48 to 72 hours. He could be discharged sooner if we capture multiple events. patient: (mother speaks) Okay. doctor: We'll also need to adjust his medications. We'll continue his current dose of Zonegran and Lamictal for now. These medications are very long-acting, and discontinuing them while he's in the hospital may simply result in severe seizures after discharge. patient: (mother speaks) I understand. doctor: I know this is a lot to take in. But we're here to help. We'll do everything we can to get patient feeling better. patient: (mother speaks) Thank you.\",\n          \"doctor: Hello patient, how are you doing today? patient: I'm not doing too well, doctor. I've been having these episodes where my face feels like it's going to twitch. I can usually suppress it by grimacing, but it's still really annoying. doctor: I see. And how often do these episodes happen? patient: It used to be several times a day, but now it's down to maybe once a week. doctor: That's good to hear. It sounds like it's improving. patient: Yeah, a little bit. But I'm still having this weird pressure-like sensation in the right side of my head. It feels like tingling, and sometimes it feels like water is running down my hair. doctor: Interesting. And how often does that happen? patient: It's also decreased in frequency. It used to be every day, but now it's about once a week. And it usually goes away if I take some Aleve. doctor: Okay, that's helpful to know. Now, I understand you're also having some problems with sleepiness and fatigue. Can you tell me more about that? patient: Yes, I'm always tired. I have trouble falling asleep at night, even though I work from 4 pm to midnight. When I finally do fall asleep, I wake up by 9 am and can't get back to sleep. I usually only get about five or six hours of sleep a night. doctor: I see. And do you have any other symptoms, like snoring or gasping for breath at night? patient: I think I might snore, but I'm not sure. I don't remember waking up gasping for breath. doctor: Okay. Well, I've reviewed your medical history and your recent MRI results. The MRI showed a small abnormality in your right clivus and petrous carotid canal, but it's not clear what it is. It's unlikely to be related to your facial twitching or your headache. patient: That's a relief. doctor: I think the best course of action for now is to continue observing your symptoms. We can repeat the MRI in four months to see if there's any change. In the meantime, let's focus on addressing your sleep problems. patient: Okay. What can I do about that? doctor: Well, first, we need to try to get you on a more regular sleep schedule. Try going to bed later, at least 10 pm or 10:30 pm, so that you can get a full night's sleep. We can also talk about weight loss and exercise, which can also help improve sleep quality. patient: I'll try that. doctor: Great. I'm also going to recommend a sleep study to rule out obstructive sleep apnea. patient: Okay. doctor: We'll follow up in five months to see how you're doing. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen or you have any new concerns, please don't hesitate to call my office. patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.\",\n          \"doctor: Hello, I'm Dr. doctor's name. I understand you're here because you've been experiencing some manic symptoms. Can you tell me a little bit about what's been going on? patient: Well, I've been feeling really restless and energetic. I haven't been able to sleep for days. I've also been having some strange thoughts and beliefs. Like, I believe I can fly. And I've been acting impulsively, like trying to put my hand in the garbage disposal and climbing over the balcony. doctor: I see. And have you been taking your medications? patient: No, I haven't taken them in a few days. doctor: I understand. It's important to take your medications as prescribed. They can help to stabilize your mood and prevent these manic episodes. patient: I know, but I just don't like the way they make me feel. They make me feel tired and groggy. doctor: I understand that. But the benefits of taking your medications outweigh the risks. They can help to prevent you from harming yourself or others. patient: I guess you're right. I'll start taking them again. doctor: That's good to hear. I'm also going to prescribe you a new medication called Abilify. It can help to reduce the symptoms of mania. patient: Okay. doctor: I'm also going to recommend that you see a therapist. They can help you to learn how to manage your symptoms and cope with stress. patient: I'm not sure I want to see a therapist. doctor: I understand that. But it's important to get help. A therapist can help you to get your life back on track. patient: I'll think about it. doctor: Okay. In the meantime, I'm going to keep you here in the hospital for observation. We'll monitor your symptoms and make sure you're safe. patient: Okay. doctor: I'm also going to order some blood tests to make sure there's nothing else going on that could be causing your symptoms. patient: Okay. doctor: I'll be back to check on you later. patient: Okay. doctor: (to the nurse) Please make sure the patient takes her medications as prescribed. And keep an eye on her for any signs of worsening symptoms. nurse: I will, doctor.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"note\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 96,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Seizures. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a young male who presents to the clinic with his mother for evaluation of new onset tonic seizures. The patient's mother reports that he has been having seizures more frequently, at least multiple times a week, sometimes with multiple days in a row with seizures. She describes these new seizures as tonic spells, with stiffening and eye rolling, as well as crying and vomiting after some of them. The patient has not had any of his typical seizures for some time. The patient is currently taking Zonegran and Lamictal for his seizures. His mother understands that these medications will be continued at his current dose during his hospitalization. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. Complex partial seizures and new-onset tonic seizures Assessment: The patient has a history of complex partial seizures that have recently become more frequent and severe. He is also experiencing new-onset tonic seizures. These seizures are characterized by stiffening, eye rolling back, crying, and vomiting.

Thank you for coming in today. I understand you've been experiencing some confusion and had a stroke. patient: Yes, that's right. I'm not sure why I'm here, but I had a stroke. doctor: I see. Well, let's start by going over your medical history. You have a history of coronary artery disease and had bypass grafting surgery in the past. Do you remember when and where that was? patient: I'm not sure. I don't remember much about it. doctor: That's okay. We can look that up in your chart. It also says here that you have carotid artery stenosis and had right carotid artery stenting. Again, do you recall when that was? patient: No, I don't remember that either. doctor: No problem. Additionally, you have diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a history of stroke with left-sided hemiplegia. patient: Yes, I remember having a stroke. doctor: I understand. Now, let's talk about your current symptoms. You mentioned confusion. Can you tell me more about that? patient: Well, I've been feeling disoriented and forgetful. I also had trouble speaking and understanding others. doctor: I see. And have you experienced any chest discomfort, shortness of breath, or palpitations? patient: No, I haven't had any of those symptoms. doctor: That's good to hear. I've reviewed your EKG and telemetry results. It shows that you have atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. However, your current telemetry shows normal sinus rhythm. patient: What does that mean? doctor: Atrial fibrillation is a heart rhythm disorder where the upper chambers of your heart (the atria) beat irregularly and rapidly. This can lead to a rapid heart rate and an increased risk of stroke. patient: That sounds serious. doctor: It can be, but we're going to take steps to manage it. I've consulted with cardiology, and we recommend starting you on Coumadin to prevent further strokes. However, given your current neurological status, we need to assess your risk of falling. If the risk is low, we'll proceed with Coumadin. Otherwise, we'll consider aspirin and Plavix. patient: I understand. doctor: Additionally, you have carotid artery stenosis. We'll order a CT angio of the carotid to assess stent patency. However, given your recent stroke, revascularization is not indicated at this time. patient: Okay. doctor: Finally, you have coronary artery disease, but you're clinically stable. We'll monitor that closely. patient: Thank you for explaining everything to me. doctor: You're welcome. We'll continue to monitor your condition and make any necessary adjustments to your treatment plan.\",\n          \"doctor: Hello, patient. I understand you're here today for foot pain? patient: Yes, that's right. I've been having pain in my foot for a while now, and it's been getting worse lately. doctor: Can you tell me more about the pain? Where exactly is it located? patient: It's on the top and lateral aspect of my foot, below my ankle. It's a sharp, stabbing pain that gets worse when I walk or exercise. doctor: Have you seen a doctor about this pain before? patient: Yes, I saw Dr. XYZ last week for back pain, and he prescribed me some pain medication and muscle relaxers. But I've been in here multiple times for different kinds of pain. doctor: I see. And have you had any recent injuries to your foot? patient: No, I haven't injured it recently. It's just been chronically painful. doctor: I understand. Well, let me take a look at your foot. doctor (after examining the patient's foot): Your foot looks okay. There's no redness, swelling, or warmth. The surgical scars are well-healed. There is some mild tenderness around the medial side of your foot, just below the medial malleolus. patient: Yeah, that's where it hurts the most. doctor: I think the pain you're experiencing is likely due to the hardware in your foot. It's possible that the hardware is causing some irritation or inflammation. patient: So, what can I do about it? doctor: Well, we can try some different things to see what helps. I'm going to prescribe you some Lortab 7.5 to help with the pain. I'm also going to refer you to a specialist who can evaluate your foot and determine if the hardware needs to be removed. patient: Okay, thank you. doctor: You're welcome. I hope this helps. patient: Me too. doctor: I also want to talk to you about your primary care physician. You've been seen here multiple times for pain, and it's important to have a regular doctor who can oversee your care. patient: I know, I've been trying to find one. I was supposed to see Dr. XYZ today, but they canceled my appointment because I don't have Project Access insurance yet. doctor: I see. Well, I'm glad to hear that Project Access will be approving your insurance next week. In the meantime, I'm going to keep your chart open so that we can follow up with you and make sure you're getting the care you need. patient: Thank you, I appreciate that. doctor: You're welcome. I'm here to help.\",\n          \"doctor today i'm seeing christina cooper . her date of birth is 07/01/1954 . uh , ms. cooper is a new patient who was referred by diane nelson for a long-standing iron deficiency anemia . doctor hello , how are you ? patient i'm good , thank you . doctor so tell me what brings you in today . patient recently i tried to donate blood , around december i think , and they told me i was anemic , which is something i've been dealing with for a while , so it's not the first time i've been told i'm anemic . doctor or how have you been feeling in general with this ? patient not great . i have been feeling fatigued often during the day , and even feverish with chills at times . when i try to be active i like i ca n't catch my breath and i feel like i'm wheezing . i've had some headaches too , which is not like me . doctor okay . are there any other symptoms ? patient i've been noting some chilling sensations . i also get cold so easily . it's annoying . i feel like i have to really bundle up . i do n't know if this is related but my anxiety and depression feel like it has been getting worse lately . i feel like a mess . doctor sounds like you're not feeling great , obviously . and i'm glad you came to see us . um , we're certainly going to try to figure this out and figure out what's going on , uh , but it sounds like you've been dealing with this anemia for a long time ? patient yeah , i've been anemic since i was 13 years old . doctor right . so why do your doctors think you're anemic ? do you have a history of heavy periods ? patient well i did have heavy periods until i had a hysterectomy in 1996 . but no , they have not told me why they think i'm anemic , which is frustrating honestly . doctor yeah . i can imagine that is . um , let's see if we can help though . since you had your hysterectomy your periods , of course , are no longer the issue . um , when was your last colonoscopy ? patient about five to six years ago . doctor and was it relatively a normal exam ? did you have any polyps ? patient no . they said they'd see me in 10 years . doctor well that's good news . patient yeah , i agree . doctor um , do you have a pacemaker or defibrillator , or have sleep apnea , or use oxygen at night ? patient no . doctor all right . do you ever drink alcohol ? patient yeah , but only once or twice a year . doctor okay . are you taking any supplements such as iron or vitamin b12 ? patient i already started taking my iron pills which i have not taken in about a year . doctor all right . and what are you taking ? patient i'm taking 25 milligram tablets , twice daily . doctor okay , and that's the , the ferrous sulfate ? patient yeah , that's it . i take one in the morning and one in the evening . doctor okay . anything else ? patient yeah , i take vitamin b12 , just the over the counter stuff . doctor okay , very good . all right , well let's go ahead and take a look and see what's going on . patient sounds good . thank you . doctor of course . you'll hear me , uh , talk through your exam so that i get all the information documented . patient okay . doctor all right . so use my general physical exam template . i will start by listening to your heart and lungs . patient okay . doctor all right . next , i'd like you to lay back so i can examine your abdomen . patient okay . doctor is there any tenderness where i'm pressing ? patient no . doctor okay . you can sit up . so your physical exam is normal without any significant findings . all right ms. cooper , often when we initially see anemia and your host of symptoms , we suspect internal bleeding . patient is that why they want me to have another upper endoscopy ? doctor actually it would be an upper endoscopy and a colonoscopy , but yes , likely that's the reason why . patient lovely . doctor yeah . unfortunately our cameras do not meet all the way in the middle , so if those tests back , come , if those tests come back fine , then we'll have you swallow a pill camera to take pictures as it moves through your , uh , system . patient okay . doctor we may not need to , but it's just the first thing we can do to make sure that you're not losing blood . um , the second thing we can do is have you see a hematologist . they will tell us if you need to give any , to give you any intravenous iron , or maybe something to help your body store the iron better . patient all right . doctor so let's go ahead , get your upper endoscopy and colonoscopy scheduled . patient okay . doctor um , have you ever had any issue with sedation in the past ? patient no , i was just sleepy afterwards . doctor okay . well we will give you a bowel prep to clean out your bowels ahead of time . um , if we do these tests and they are normal , like i said , then we will consider that capsule endoscopy . patient okay . sounds like a plan . doctor all right . so after that you'll be all done and we will send you to the hematologist . additionally , i'm going to need you to start taking your iron pills with orange juice . uh , the vitamin c will help you absorb the iron better . do this for about 8-12 weeks , uh , and then we can reassess your blood work . patient okay , that sounds great . doctor all right . well i think we have our plan . on your way out , stop by and schedule your upper endoscopy and c- colonoscopy . uh , we will send a referral to dr. flores who is is the hematologist , so schedule that appointment . um , here are your instructions for the pre- uh , the bowel prep . uh , call us if you have any questions or worsening symptoms . we'll be happy to help you . patient thank you . doctor you're welcome . have a great day , have a great day ms. cooper . patient you too . doctor all right . this is christina cooper , pleasant 65 year old female who was diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia in 12-2019 , and w- and was unable to donate blood . um , her followup blood work on 01/20/20 was revealed a low hemoglobin , stable hematocrit and normal iron labs , although ferritin was low . um , she was taking ferrous sulfate , three hundred , twenty phil- 25 milligrams by mouth . i've asked her to continue each dose with vitamin c found in orange juice , for the next 12 weeks , then recheck to the cbc , iron , ferritin , b12 , and folate . um , a referral was sent to her hematologist . we will plan for an egd and a colonoscopy to assess for potential sources of anemia or gi bleed . if this is inconclusive , capsule endoscopy will be considered . thanks .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"note\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 180,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Confusion and history of stroke. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a pleasant age-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of confusion and history of stroke. The patient reports feeling disoriented and forgetful. She also had trouble speaking and understanding others. She denies chest discomfort, shortness of breath, or palpitations. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and had bypass grafting surgery in the past. She also has carotid artery stenosis and had right carotid artery stenting. Additionally, she has diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a history of stroke with left-sided hemiplegia. The patient's EKG and telemetry results show atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. However, her current telemetry shows normal sinus rhythm. The patient has carotid artery stenosis. A CT angio of the carotid will be ordered to assess stent patency. The patient will be started on Coumadin to prevent further strokes. However, given her current neurological status, the risk of falling will be assessed. If the risk is low, Coumadin will be initiated. Otherwise, aspirin and Plavix will be considered. The patient will be monitored closely for her coronary artery disease. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response Assessment: Atrial fibrillation is a heart rhythm disorder where the upper chambers of the patient's heart (the atria) beat irregularly and rapidly. This can lead to a rapid heart rate and an increased risk of stroke. The patient has a history of stroke, which is a risk factor for developing atrial fibrillation. Plan: - Will consult cardiology. - Will assess patient's risk of falling. - If risk is low, will start Coumadin. If risk is high, will consider aspirin and Plavix. 2. Carotid artery stenosis Assessment: Carotid artery stenosis is a narrowing of the carotid arteries, which are the main arteries that supply blood to the brain. This can increase the risk of stroke. The patient had right carotid artery stenting in the past, but the patency of the stent is unknown. Plan: - Will order CT angio of the carotid to assess stent patency. 3. Coronary artery disease Assessment: Coronary artery disease is a narrowing of the arteries that supply blood to the heart. This can lead to chest pain, shortness of breath, and heart attacks. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and had bypass grafting surgery in the past. He is currently clinically stable. Plan: - Will monitor the patient's condition closely. 4. Left-sided hemiplegia Assessment: Left-sided hemiplegia is a weakness or paralysis of the left side of the body. This is a result of the patient's previous stroke. Plan: - Will continue to monitor the patient's neurological status. - Will provide rehabilitation as needed. Follow-up instructions: - The patient will follow up with cardiology in 1 week.\",\n          \"SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Foot pain.

She was taking ferrous sulfate, three hundred, twenty-five milligrams by mouth. The patient reports feeling fatigued during the day and experiences fevers with chills at times. She also notes dyspnea on exertion, headaches, cold sensitivity, anxiety, and depression. She had a hysterectomy in 1996, and her last colonoscopy was about five to six years ago, which was relatively normal. She denies a history of heavy periods, alcohol use, or use of oxygen at night. She takes over-the-counter vitamin B12 and recently started taking her iron pills again, one in the morning and one in the evening. The patient has been instructed to continue each dose with vitamin C found in orange juice for the next 12 weeks, then recheck the CBC, iron, ferritin, B12, and folate. A referral was sent to her hematologist. The plan is for an EGD and a colonoscopy to assess for potential sources of anemia or GI bleed. If this is inconclusive, capsule endoscopy will be considered. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. Iron deficiency anemia Assessment: Patient has long-standing iron deficiency anemia, with low hemoglobin and low ferritin. She has taken ferrous sulfate 25mg BID and over-the-counter vitamin B12. Plan: - Continue ferrous sulfate 25mg BID with orange juice for 8-12 weeks, then recheck CBC, iron, ferritin, B12, and folate. - Referred to hematology for further evaluation and management. - Schedule EGD and colonoscopy to assess for potential sources of anemia or GI bleed. If inconclusive, capsule endoscopy will be considered. 2. Chilling sensation, cold intolerance, fatigue, shortness of breath, headache, anxiety, and depression Assessment: Patient has a constellation of symptoms that may be related to anemia, including chilling sensation, cold intolerance, fatigue, shortness of breath, headache, anxiety, and depression. Plan: - Treat the underlying iron deficiency anemia. - Provide supportive care for symptoms as needed.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n

Well, I'm going to examine you now and then we'll talk about the next steps. doctor: (examines the patient) doctor: Okay, I've reviewed your medical history and your test results from ABC Medical Center. It seems like you have a urinary tract infection, which is causing some of your symptoms. We're going to start you on antibiotics to treat that. doctor: I'm also concerned about the weakness on your right side and the difficulty speaking. These symptoms could be caused by a stroke or a transient ischemic attack (TIA). We're going to order an MRI, an ultrasound of your carotids, and an echocardiogram to get a better look at your brain and your heart. doctor: In the meantime, we're going to give you some fluids to help with your dehydration and we're going to start you on antiplatelet therapy to help prevent further strokes. doctor: We're also going to check your blood sugar levels and adjust your diabetes medication as needed. doctor: I've also ordered a urine culture to see what kind of bacteria is causing your urinary tract infection. Once we have the results, we can adjust your antibiotics if necessary. doctor: I'm going to ask a neurologist to come and see you to help us figure out what's causing your weakness and difficulty speaking. patient: (nods) daughter: Thank you, doctor.

I understand you're here for a follow-up visit after your recent total vaginal hysterectomy. Patient: That's right, doctor. Doctor: Can you tell me a little bit about your medical history? Patient: Well, I've had seven pregnancies, with five term deliveries. I also have a history of tobacco use. Doctor: Okay, and what brought you to the hospital this time? Patient: I had an abnormal Pap smear in the 80s, but I didn't follow up on it until this year. A biopsy showed microinvasive carcinoma of the cervix, and I had a cone biopsy on February 12th, which also showed microinvasive carcinoma with a 1 mm invasion. Doctor: I see. So, you elected to have a total vaginal hysterectomy as definitive therapy? Patient: Yes, that's right. I'm aware that I'll need to continue having Pap smears in the future. Doctor: That's good to hear. I'm glad you're taking your health seriously. Now, let's talk about your surgery. How have you been feeling since the procedure? Patient: I've been doing really well. My bowel and bladder function returned quickly, and I'm ambulating well and tolerating a regular diet. Doctor: That's great news. I'm glad to hear that you're recovering so well. I did review your medical records and noted that you had an incidental cystotomy during the surgery. Patient: Yes, that's right. But I understand that it was repaired intraoperatively without any difficulty. Doctor: Correct. And your final pathology report came back free of residual disease, which is excellent news. Patient: I'm so relieved to hear that. Doctor: Me too. Now, let's talk about your discharge instructions. You'll need to take Vicodin, Motrin, and Macrodantin at bedtime for urinary tract infection suppression. Patient: Okay, I'll make sure to do that. Doctor: And you'll need to follow up with me in ten days for a cystogram and catheter removal. We'll also discuss your office follow-up at that time. Patient: I'll be sure to come in for my follow-up appointment. Doctor: Good. I'm glad we were able to get this all taken care of.

I also get nauseous and belch a lot. And I've been having trouble swallowing solids. doctor: How long have you been having these problems? patient: The heartburn and indigestion have been going on for years. The trouble swallowing started a few years ago. doctor: Have you noticed any other changes in your bowel habits? patient: Yes, I have. I've been alternating between constipation and diarrhea for the past several years. I also get some lower abdominal cramping and discomfort, especially when I'm constipated. doctor: Do you take any medications for these problems? patient: Yes, I take a lot of medications. I take Tramadol, hydrocodone, zolpidem, triamterene, atenolol, vitamin D, TriCor, simvastatin, ibuprofen, and Lyrica. doctor: I see. Well, I think we need to do some tests to figure out what's causing your problems. I'd like to order an upper endoscopy and a colonoscopy. patient: What are those? doctor: An upper endoscopy is a procedure where we insert a thin tube with a camera on the end down your throat to look at your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. A colonoscopy is a procedure where we insert a thin tube with a camera on the end into your rectum to look at your colon. patient: Okay. And what if they find something? doctor: If we find anything abnormal, we can take a biopsy to test it. patient: I see. Well, I guess I'll do it. doctor: Okay. I'll also prescribe some medications to help with your heartburn and indigestion. patient: Thank you. doctor: You're welcome.

Thank you for coming in today. I understand you've been experiencing some confusion and had a stroke. patient: Yes, that's right. I'm not sure why I'm here, but I had a stroke. doctor: I see. Well, let's start by going over your medical history. You have a history of coronary artery disease and had bypass grafting surgery in the past. Do you remember when and where that was? patient: I'm not sure. I don't remember much about it. doctor: That's okay. We can look that up in your chart. It also says here that you have carotid artery stenosis and had right carotid artery stenting. Again, do you recall when that was? patient: No, I don't remember that either. doctor: No problem. Additionally, you have diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a history of stroke with left-sided hemiplegia. patient: Yes, I remember having a stroke. doctor: I understand. Now, let's talk about your current symptoms. You mentioned confusion. Can you tell me more about that? patient: Well, I've been feeling disoriented and forgetful. I also had trouble speaking and understanding others. doctor: I see. And have you experienced any chest discomfort, shortness of breath, or palpitations? patient: No, I haven't had any of those symptoms. doctor: That's good to hear. I've reviewed your EKG and telemetry results. It shows that you have atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. However, your current telemetry shows normal sinus rhythm. patient: What does that mean? doctor: Atrial fibrillation is a heart rhythm disorder where the upper chambers of your heart (the atria) beat irregularly and rapidly. This can lead to a rapid heart rate and an increased risk of stroke. patient: That sounds serious. doctor: It can be, but we're going to take steps to manage it. I've consulted with cardiology, and we recommend starting you on Coumadin to prevent further strokes. However, given your current neurological status, we need to assess your risk of falling. If the risk is low, we'll proceed with Coumadin. Otherwise, we'll consider aspirin and Plavix. patient: I understand. doctor: Additionally, you have carotid artery stenosis. We'll order a CT angio of the carotid to assess stent patency. However, given your recent stroke, revascularization is not indicated at this time. patient: Okay. doctor: Finally, you have coronary artery disease, but you're clinically stable. We'll monitor that closely. patient: Thank you for explaining everything to me. doctor: You're welcome. We'll continue to monitor your condition and make any necessary adjustments to your treatment plan.\",\n          \"doctor: Hello, patient. I understand you're here today for foot pain? patient: Yes, that's right. I've been having pain in my foot for a while now, and it's been getting worse lately. doctor: Can you tell me more about the pain? Where exactly is it located? patient: It's on the top and lateral aspect of my foot, below my ankle. It's a sharp, stabbing pain that gets worse when I walk or exercise. doctor: Have you seen a doctor about this pain before? patient: Yes, I saw Dr. XYZ last week for back pain, and he prescribed me some pain medication and muscle relaxers. But I've been in here multiple times for different kinds of pain. doctor: I see. And have you had any recent injuries to your foot? patient: No, I haven't injured it recently. It's just been chronically painful. doctor: I understand. Well, let me take a look at your foot. doctor (after examining the patient's foot): Your foot looks okay. There's no redness, swelling, or warmth. The surgical scars are well-healed. There is some mild tenderness around the medial side of your foot, just below the medial malleolus. patient: Yeah, that's where it hurts the most. doctor: I think the pain you're experiencing is likely due to the hardware in your foot. It's possible that the hardware is causing some irritation or inflammation. patient: So, what can I do about it? doctor: Well, we can try some different things to see what helps. I'm going to prescribe you some Lortab 7.5 to help with the pain. I'm also going to refer you to a specialist who can evaluate your foot and determine if the hardware needs to be removed. patient: Okay, thank you. doctor: You're welcome. I hope this helps. patient: Me too. doctor: I also want to talk to you about your primary care physician. You've been seen here multiple times for pain, and it's important to have a regular doctor who can oversee your care. patient: I know, I've been trying to find one. I was supposed to see Dr. XYZ today, but they canceled my appointment because I don't have Project Access insurance yet. doctor: I see. Well, I'm glad to hear that Project Access will be approving your insurance next week. In the meantime, I'm going to keep your chart open so that we can follow up with you and make sure you're getting the care you need. patient: Thank you, I appreciate that. doctor: You're welcome. I'm here to help.\",\n          \"doctor today i'm seeing christina cooper . her date of birth is 07/01/1954 . uh , ms. cooper is a new patient who was referred by diane nelson for a long-standing iron deficiency anemia . doctor hello , how are you ? patient i'm good , thank you . doctor so tell me what brings you in today . patient recently i tried to donate blood , around december i think , and they told me i was anemic , which is something i've been dealing with for a while , so it's not the first time i've been told i'm anemic . doctor or how have you been feeling in general with this ? patient not great . i have been feeling fatigued often during the day , and even feverish with chills at times . when i try to be active i like i ca n't catch my breath and i feel like i'm wheezing . i've had some headaches too , which is not like me . doctor okay . are there any other symptoms ? patient i've been noting some chilling sensations . i also get cold so easily . it's annoying . i feel like i have to really bundle up . i do n't know if this is related but my anxiety and depression feel like it has been getting worse lately . i feel like a mess . doctor sounds like you're not feeling great , obviously . and i'm glad you came to see us . um , we're certainly going to try to figure this out and figure out what's going on , uh , but it sounds like you've been dealing with this anemia for a long time ? patient yeah , i've been anemic since i was 13 years old . doctor right . so why do your doctors think you're anemic ? do you have a history of heavy periods ? patient well i did have heavy periods until i had a hysterectomy in 1996 . but no , they have not told me why they think i'm anemic , which is frustrating honestly . doctor yeah . i can imagine that is . um , let's see if we can help though . since you had your hysterectomy your periods , of course , are no longer the issue . um , when was your last colonoscopy ? patient about five to six years ago . doctor and was it relatively a normal exam ? did you have any polyps ? patient no . they said they'd see me in 10 years . doctor well that's good news . patient yeah , i agree . doctor um , do you have a pacemaker or defibrillator , or have sleep apnea , or use oxygen at night ? patient no . doctor all right . do you ever drink alcohol ? patient yeah , but only once or twice a year . doctor okay . are you taking any supplements such as iron or vitamin b12 ? patient i already started taking my iron pills which i have not taken in about a year . doctor all right . and what are you taking ? patient i'm taking 25 milligram tablets , twice daily . doctor okay , and that's the , the ferrous sulfate ? patient yeah , that's it . i take one in the morning and one in the evening . doctor okay . anything else ? patient yeah , i take vitamin b12 , just the over the counter stuff . doctor okay , very good . all right , well let's go ahead and take a look and see what's going on . patient sounds good . thank you . doctor of course . you'll hear me , uh , talk through your exam so that i get all the information documented . patient okay . doctor all right . so use my general physical exam template . i will start by listening to your heart and lungs . patient okay . doctor all right . next , i'd like you to lay back so i can examine your abdomen . patient okay . doctor is there any tenderness where i'm pressing ? patient no . doctor okay . you can sit up . so your physical exam is normal without any significant findings . all right ms. cooper , often when we initially see anemia and your host of symptoms , we suspect internal bleeding . patient is that why they want me to have another upper endoscopy ? doctor actually it would be an upper endoscopy and a colonoscopy , but yes , likely that's the reason why . patient lovely . doctor yeah . unfortunately our cameras do not meet all the way in the middle , so if those tests back , come , if those tests come back fine , then we'll have you swallow a pill camera to take pictures as it moves through your , uh , system . patient okay . doctor we may not need to , but it's just the first thing we can do to make sure that you're not losing blood . um , the second thing we can do is have you see a hematologist . they will tell us if you need to give any , to give you any intravenous iron , or maybe something to help your body store the iron better . patient all right . doctor so let's go ahead , get your upper endoscopy and colonoscopy scheduled . patient okay . doctor um , have you ever had any issue with sedation in the past ? patient no , i was just sleepy afterwards . doctor okay . well we will give you a bowel prep to clean out your bowels ahead of time . um , if we do these tests and they are normal , like i said , then we will consider that capsule endoscopy . patient okay . sounds like a plan . doctor all right . so after that you'll be all done and we will send you to the hematologist . additionally , i'm going to need you to start taking your iron pills with orange juice . uh , the vitamin c will help you absorb the iron better . do this for about 8-12 weeks , uh , and then we can reassess your blood work . patient okay , that sounds great . doctor all right . well i think we have our plan . on your way out , stop by and schedule your upper endoscopy and c- colonoscopy . uh , we will send a referral to dr. flores who is is the hematologist , so schedule that appointment . um , here are your instructions for the pre- uh , the bowel prep . uh , call us if you have any questions or worsening symptoms . we'll be happy to help you . patient thank you . doctor you're welcome . have a great day , have a great day ms. cooper . patient you too . doctor all right . this is christina cooper , pleasant 65 year old female who was diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia in 12-2019 , and w- and was unable to donate blood . um , her followup blood work on 01/20/20 was revealed a low hemoglobin , stable hematocrit and normal iron labs , although ferritin was low . um , she was taking ferrous sulfate , three hundred , twenty phil- 25 milligrams by mouth . i've asked her to continue each dose with vitamin c found in orange juice , for the next 12 weeks , then recheck to the cbc , iron , ferritin , b12 , and folate . um , a referral was sent to her hematologist . we will plan for an egd and a colonoscopy to assess for potential sources of anemia or gi bleed . if this is inconclusive , capsule endoscopy will be considered . thanks .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"note\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 180,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Confusion and history of stroke. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a pleasant age-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of confusion and history of stroke. The patient reports feeling disoriented and forgetful. She also had trouble speaking and understanding others. She denies chest discomfort, shortness of breath, or palpitations. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and had bypass grafting surgery in the past. She also has carotid artery stenosis and had right carotid artery stenting. Additionally, she has diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a history of stroke with left-sided hemiplegia. The patient's EKG and telemetry results show atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. However, her current telemetry shows normal sinus rhythm. The patient has carotid artery stenosis. A CT angio of the carotid will be ordered to assess stent patency. The patient will be started on Coumadin to prevent further strokes. However, given her current neurological status, the risk of falling will be assessed. If the risk is low, Coumadin will be initiated. Otherwise, aspirin and Plavix will be considered. The patient will be monitored closely for her coronary artery disease. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response Assessment: Atrial fibrillation is a heart rhythm disorder where the upper chambers of the patient's heart (the atria) beat irregularly and rapidly. This can lead to a rapid heart rate and an increased risk of stroke. The patient has a history of stroke, which is a risk factor for developing atrial fibrillation. Plan: - Will consult cardiology. - Will assess patient's risk of falling. - If risk is low, will start Coumadin. If risk is high, will consider aspirin and Plavix. 2. Carotid artery stenosis Assessment: Carotid artery stenosis is a narrowing of the carotid arteries, which are the main arteries that supply blood to the brain. This can increase the risk of stroke. The patient had right carotid artery stenting in the past, but the patency of the stent is unknown. Plan: - Will order CT angio of the carotid to assess stent patency. 3. Coronary artery disease Assessment: Coronary artery disease is a narrowing of the arteries that supply blood to the heart. This can lead to chest pain, shortness of breath, and heart attacks. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and had bypass grafting surgery in the past. He is currently clinically stable. Plan: - Will monitor the patient's condition closely. 4. Left-sided hemiplegia Assessment: Left-sided hemiplegia is a weakness or paralysis of the left side of the body. This is a result of the patient's previous stroke. Plan: - Will continue to monitor the patient's neurological status. - Will provide rehabilitation as needed. Follow-up instructions: - The patient will follow up with cardiology in 1 week.\",\n          \"SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Foot pain.

She takes over-the-counter vitamin B12 and recently started taking her iron pills again, one in the morning and one in the evening. The patient has been instructed to continue each dose with vitamin C found in orange juice for the next 12 weeks, then recheck the CBC, iron, ferritin, B12, and folate. A referral was sent to her hematologist. The plan is for an EGD and a colonoscopy to assess for potential sources of anemia or GI bleed. If this is inconclusive, capsule endoscopy will be considered. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. Iron deficiency anemia Assessment: Patient has long-standing iron deficiency anemia, with low hemoglobin and low ferritin. She has taken ferrous sulfate 25mg BID and over-the-counter vitamin B12. Plan: - Continue ferrous sulfate 25mg BID with orange juice for 8-12 weeks, then recheck CBC, iron, ferritin, B12, and folate. - Referred to hematology for further evaluation and management. - Schedule EGD and colonoscopy to assess for potential sources of anemia or GI bleed. If inconclusive, capsule endoscopy will be considered. 2. Chilling sensation, cold intolerance, fatigue, shortness of breath, headache, anxiety, and depression Assessment: Patient has a constellation of symptoms that may be related to anemia, including chilling sensation, cold intolerance, fatigue, shortness of breath, headache, anxiety, and depression. Plan: - Treat the underlying iron deficiency anemia. - Provide supportive care for symptoms as needed.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"clinical_ner_label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 180,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"[{'phrase': 'confusion', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'coronary artery', 'label': 'DISEASE_DISORDER'}, {'phrase': 'disease', 'label': 'HISTORY'}, {'phrase': 'bypass', 'label': 'DISEASE_DISORDER'}, {'phrase': 'grafting surgery', 'label': 'THERAPEUTIC_PROCEDURE'}, {'phrase': 'carotid artery', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'stenosis', 'label': 'DISEASE_DISORDER'}, {'phrase': 'right carotid artery', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'stent ing', 'label': 'THERAPEUTIC_PROCEDURE'}, {'phrase': 'diabetes', 'label': 'DISEASE_DISORDER'}, {'phrase': 'hypertension', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'hyper lipid', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'emia', 'label': 'DISEASE_DISORDER'}, {'phrase': 'stroke', 'label': 'DISEASE_DISORDER'}, {'phrase': 'left -

Thank you for coming in today.

They're different from the ones he used to have. doctor: In what way? patient: (mother speaks) They're more like tonic spells. He stiffens up and his eyes roll back. He also cries and vomits after some of them. doctor: How often are these seizures happening? patient: (mother speaks) At least multiple times a week. Sometimes he has none for a few days, but then he'll have multiple days in a row with seizures. doctor: I see. And what about his other seizures? The ones he used to have? patient: (mother speaks) He hasn't had any of those in a while. doctor: That's good to hear. Now, I'm going to need to do a physical exam. Is that okay with you? patient: (nods) doctor: (performs physical exam) doctor: Everything looks good. I'm going to admit you to the hospital for a few days so we can do a video EEG. This will help us to capture both types of seizures and figure out what's causing them. patient: (mother speaks) How long will he need to stay in the hospital? doctor: Probably at least 48 to 72 hours. He could be discharged sooner if we capture multiple events. patient: (mother speaks) Okay. doctor: We'll also need to adjust his medications. We'll continue his current dose of Zonegran and Lamictal for now. These medications are very long-acting, and discontinuing them while he's in the hospital may simply result in severe seizures after discharge. patient: (mother speaks) I understand. doctor: I know this is a lot to take in.

We'll do everything we can to get patient feeling better. patient: (mother speaks) Thank you.\",\n          \"doctor: Hello patient, how are you doing today? patient: I'm not doing too well, doctor. I've been having these episodes where my face feels like it's going to twitch. I can usually suppress it by grimacing, but it's still really annoying. doctor: I see. And how often do these episodes happen? patient: It used to be several times a day, but now it's down to maybe once a week. doctor: That's good to hear. It sounds like it's improving. patient: Yeah, a little bit. But I'm still having this weird pressure-like sensation in the right side of my head. It feels like tingling, and sometimes it feels like water is running down my hair. doctor: Interesting. And how often does that happen? patient: It's also decreased in frequency. It used to be every day, but now it's about once a week. And it usually goes away if I take some Aleve. doctor: Okay, that's helpful to know. Now, I understand you're also having some problems with sleepiness and fatigue. Can you tell me more about that? patient: Yes, I'm always tired. I have trouble falling asleep at night, even though I work from 4 pm to midnight. When I finally do fall asleep, I wake up by 9 am and can't get back to sleep. I usually only get about five or six hours of sleep a night. doctor: I see. And do you have any other symptoms, like snoring or gasping for breath at night? patient: I think I might snore, but I'm not sure. I don't remember waking up gasping for breath. doctor: Okay. Well, I've reviewed your medical history and your recent MRI results. The MRI showed a small abnormality in your right clivus and petrous carotid canal, but it's not clear what it is. It's unlikely to be related to your facial twitching or your headache. patient: That's a relief. doctor: I think the best course of action for now is to continue observing your symptoms. We can repeat the MRI in four months to see if there's any change. In the meantime, let's focus on addressing your sleep problems. patient: Okay. What can I do about that? doctor: Well, first, we need to try to get you on a more regular sleep schedule. Try going to bed later, at least 10 pm or 10:30 pm, so that you can get a full night's sleep. We can also talk about weight loss and exercise, which can also help improve sleep quality. patient: I'll try that. doctor: Great. I'm also going to recommend a sleep study to rule out obstructive sleep apnea. patient: Okay. doctor: We'll follow up in five months to see how you're doing. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen or you have any new concerns, please don't hesitate to call my office. patient: Thank you, doctor.

I've also been having some strange thoughts and beliefs. Like, I believe I can fly. And I've been acting impulsively, like trying to put my hand in the garbage disposal and climbing over the balcony. doctor: I see. And have you been taking your medications? patient: No, I haven't taken them in a few days. doctor: I understand. It's important to take your medications as prescribed. They can help to stabilize your mood and prevent these manic episodes. patient: I know, but I just don't like the way they make me feel. They make me feel tired and groggy. doctor: I understand that. But the benefits of taking your medications outweigh the risks. They can help to prevent you from harming yourself or others. patient: I guess you're right. I'll start taking them again. doctor: That's good to hear. I'm also going to prescribe you a new medication called Abilify. It can help to reduce the symptoms of mania. patient: Okay. doctor: I'm also going to recommend that you see a therapist. They can help you to learn how to manage your symptoms and cope with stress. patient: I'm not sure I want to see a therapist. doctor: I understand that. But it's important to get help. A therapist can help you to get your life back on track. patient: I'll think about it. doctor: Okay. In the meantime, I'm going to keep you here in the hospital for observation. We'll monitor your symptoms and make sure you're safe. patient: Okay. doctor: I'm also going to order some blood tests to make sure there's nothing else going on that could be causing your symptoms. patient: Okay. doctor: I'll be back to check on you later. patient: Okay. doctor: (to the nurse) Please make sure the patient takes her medications as prescribed.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a young male who presents to the clinic with his mother for evaluation of new onset tonic seizures. The patient's mother reports that he has been having seizures more frequently, at least multiple times a week, sometimes with multiple days in a row with seizures. She describes these new seizures as tonic spells, with stiffening and eye rolling, as well as crying and vomiting after some of them. The patient has not had any of his typical seizures for some time. The patient is currently taking Zonegran and Lamictal for his seizures. His mother understands that these medications will be continued at his current dose during his hospitalization. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. Complex partial seizures and new-onset tonic seizures Assessment: The patient has a history of complex partial seizures that have recently become more frequent and severe. He is also experiencing new-onset tonic seizures. These seizures are characterized by stiffening, eye rolling back, crying, and vomiting. The patient's current anticonvulsant medications are not adequately controlling his seizures. Plan: - Admit to the hospital for video EEG monitoring and medication adjustment. - Continue Zonegran and Lamictal at current doses. - Consider adding a third anticonvulsant medication, such as levetiracetam or topiramate. - Work with neurology for further management. Follow-up instructions: - The patient will be followed closely in the hospital. Once his seizures are under control, he will be discharged home with instructions to follow up with his neurologist in 1 week.\",\n          \"SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Facial twitching and headache.

The patient reports that he has been experiencing episodes of facial twitching for several months. Initially, the episodes occurred several times a day, but they have now decreased to about once a week. He is able to suppress the twitching by grimacing. The patient also reports a pressure-like sensation in the right side of his head that feels like tingling or water running down his hair. This sensation used to occur daily, but it has also decreased in frequency to about once a week. The patient reports that the sensation usually goes away if he takes Aleve. The patient also reports sleepiness and fatigue. He works from 4 pm to midnight, and he has trouble falling asleep at night. He is able to fall asleep eventually, but he wakes up by 9 am and cannot get back to sleep. He usually only gets about five or six hours of sleep a night. The patient thinks he might snore, but he is not sure. He denies waking up gasping for breath at night. The patient's medical history is significant for an MRI that showed a small abnormality in his right clivus and petrous carotid canal.

Is that correct? patient: (nods) daughter: Yes, doctor, that's right. She was fine yesterday, but this morning she woke up with weakness in her right arm and trouble talking. We took her to ABC Medical Center, where they ran some tests and sent us here. doctor: I see. Well, I'm going to examine you now and then we'll talk about the next steps. doctor: (examines the patient) doctor: Okay, I've reviewed your medical history and your test results from ABC Medical Center. It seems like you have a urinary tract infection, which is causing some of your symptoms. We're going to start you on antibiotics to treat that. doctor: I'm also concerned about the weakness on your right side and the difficulty speaking. These symptoms could be caused by a stroke or a transient ischemic attack (TIA). We're going to order an MRI, an ultrasound of your carotids, and an echocardiogram to get a better look at your brain and your heart. doctor: In the meantime, we're going to give you some fluids to help with your dehydration and we're going to start you on antiplatelet therapy to help prevent further strokes. doctor: We're also going to check your blood sugar levels and adjust your diabetes medication as needed. doctor: I've also ordered a urine culture to see what kind of bacteria is causing your urinary tract infection. Once we have the results, we can adjust your antibiotics if necessary. doctor: I'm going to ask a neurologist to come and see you to help us figure out what's causing your weakness and difficulty speaking. patient: (nods) daughter: Thank you, doctor. We appreciate your help. doctor: You're welcome. I'll be back in a little while to check on you.\",\n          \"Doctor: Hello Patient, I'm Dr. Doctor, your physician. I understand you're here for a follow-up visit after your recent total vaginal hysterectomy. Patient: That's right, doctor. Doctor: Can you tell me a little bit about your medical history? Patient: Well, I've had seven pregnancies, with five term deliveries. I also have a history of tobacco use. Doctor: Okay, and what brought you to the hospital this time? Patient: I had an abnormal Pap smear in the 80s, but I didn't follow up on it until this year. A biopsy showed microinvasive carcinoma of the cervix, and I had a cone biopsy on February 12th, which also showed microinvasive carcinoma with a 1 mm invasion. Doctor: I see. So, you elected to have a total vaginal hysterectomy as definitive therapy? Patient: Yes, that's right. I'm aware that I'll need to continue having Pap smears in the future. Doctor: That's good to hear. I'm glad you're taking your health seriously. Now, let's talk about your surgery. How have you been feeling since the procedure? Patient: I've been doing really well. My bowel and bladder function returned quickly, and I'm ambulating well and tolerating a regular diet. Doctor: That's great news. I'm glad to hear that you're recovering so well. I did review your medical records and noted that you had an incidental cystotomy during the surgery. Patient: Yes, that's right. But I understand that it was repaired intraoperatively without any difficulty. Doctor: Correct. And your final pathology report came back free of residual disease, which is excellent news. Patient: I'm so relieved to hear that. Doctor: Me too. Now, let's talk about your discharge instructions. You'll need to take Vicodin, Motrin, and Macrodantin at bedtime for urinary tract infection suppression. Patient: Okay, I'll make sure to do that. Doctor: And you'll need to follow up with me in ten days for a cystogram and catheter removal. We'll also discuss your office follow-up at that time.

And what if they find something? doctor: If we find anything abnormal, we can take a biopsy to test it. patient: I see. Well, I guess I'll do it. doctor: Okay. I'll also prescribe some medications to help with your heartburn and indigestion. patient: Thank you. doctor: You're welcome. I'll see you back in a few weeks to go over the results of your tests. patient: Okay.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"note\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1102,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Weakness on right side and difficulty speaking.

She tried physical therapy without benefit and ultimately came to a subacromion decompression in November 2002. She had ongoing pain and was evaluated by Dr. X who felt that she had a possible brachial plexopathy. He also felt she had a right superficial radial neuritis and blocked this with resolution of her symptoms. He then referred her to ABCD who did EMG testing, demonstrating a right suprascapular neuropathy although a C5 radiculopathy could not be ruled out. MRI testing on the cervical spine was then done which was negative for disk herniation and she underwent suprascapular nerve decompression of the scapular notch on 12/18/03. She finally went to an anterior axillary nerve block because of ongoing pain in the anterior shoulder again by Dr. X. She comes to me for impairment rating.

Patient: Right side is giving me more problems than the left. Doctor: Anything else that you noticed? Patient: Yeah, one more thing I noticed is that sometimes when I am sleeping in the night, I feel this sharp shooting pain and weakness. It goes down my left side of upper, I mean, whole hand and I feel scared after that. Doctor: Are you seeing anyone for that? Patient: Yeah, Doctor X is trying to help me, uh, with that without surgery. His methods are good it and it is helping me with my neck pain, but not hand.

The other day, I had a lot of difficulty getting up from my chair because of weakness all over and a lightheadedness I can't seem to explain. Doctor: Is this new for you? Patient: Um I mean I've had falling spells several times a month for the past year, but I've always been able to get myself up one way or another. Doctor: Do you remember losing consciousness during any of those episodes? Patient: Not that I recall. I've noticed I'm a lot weaker than before so maybe that's why I keep falling more frequently. Doctor: I see. Do you experience room spinning dizziness at all? Patient: No. I also forgot to mention that four hours after not being able to get up from my chair, my left hand became numb for about two hours. Doctor: Are you right or left handed?

Doctor: Any chest pain or shortness of breath that wakes you in the middle of the night? Patient: Nope. Doctor: Do you feel short of breath when you move around? Patient: Nope. Doctor: Any visual, hearing, or swallowing problems? Patient: None. Doctor: And finally any changes to your bowel movements or urinary habits? Patient: Nope. All normal.\",\n          \"Doctor: Are you still working? Patient: Retired some time ago. Doctor: What was your profession? Patient: I used to work at a car repair shop called Champion Automotive Company. Doctor: Nice. How did you enjoy the work?

He's almost always busy. Patient: Yeah, it can be a lot sometimes. Doctor: Any smoking, drinking, or hard drugs? Patient: I can confidently say no to each one. Doctor: Great to hear.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"clinical_ner_label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n

Is that correct? patient: (nods) daughter: Yes, doctor, that's right. She was fine yesterday, but this morning she woke up with weakness in her right arm and trouble talking. We took her to ABC Medical Center, where they ran some tests and sent us here. doctor: I see. Well, I'm going to examine you now and then we'll talk about the next steps. doctor: (examines the patient) doctor: Okay, I've reviewed your medical history and your test results from ABC Medical Center. It seems like you have a urinary tract infection, which is causing some of your symptoms. We're going to start you on antibiotics to treat that. doctor: I'm also concerned about the weakness on your right side and the difficulty speaking. These symptoms could be caused by a stroke or a transient ischemic attack (TIA). We're going to order an MRI, an ultrasound of your carotids, and an echocardiogram to get a better look at your brain and your heart. doctor: In the meantime, we're going to give you some fluids to help with your dehydration and we're going to start you on antiplatelet therapy to help prevent further strokes. doctor: We're also going to check your blood sugar levels and adjust your diabetes medication as needed. doctor: I've also ordered a urine culture to see what kind of bacteria is causing your urinary tract infection. Once we have the results, we can adjust your antibiotics if necessary. doctor: I'm going to ask a neurologist to come and see you to help us figure out what's causing your weakness and difficulty speaking. patient: (nods) daughter: Thank you, doctor. We appreciate your help. doctor: You're welcome. I'll be back in a little while to check on you.\",\n          \"Doctor: Hello Patient, I'm Dr. Doctor, your physician. I understand you're here for a follow-up visit after your recent total vaginal hysterectomy. Patient: That's right, doctor. Doctor: Can you tell me a little bit about your medical history? Patient: Well, I've had seven pregnancies, with five term deliveries. I also have a history of tobacco use. Doctor: Okay, and what brought you to the hospital this time? Patient: I had an abnormal Pap smear in the 80s, but I didn't follow up on it until this year. A biopsy showed microinvasive carcinoma of the cervix, and I had a cone biopsy on February 12th, which also showed microinvasive carcinoma with a 1 mm invasion. Doctor: I see. So, you elected to have a total vaginal hysterectomy as definitive therapy? Patient: Yes, that's right. I'm aware that I'll need to continue having Pap smears in the future. Doctor: That's good to hear. I'm glad you're taking your health seriously. Now, let's talk about your surgery. How have you been feeling since the procedure? Patient: I've been doing really well. My bowel and bladder function returned quickly, and I'm ambulating well and tolerating a regular diet. Doctor: That's great news. I'm glad to hear that you're recovering so well. I did review your medical records and noted that you had an incidental cystotomy during the surgery. Patient: Yes, that's right. But I understand that it was repaired intraoperatively without any difficulty. Doctor: Correct. And your final pathology report came back free of residual disease, which is excellent news. Patient: I'm so relieved to hear that. Doctor: Me too. Now, let's talk about your discharge instructions. You'll need to take Vicodin, Motrin, and Macrodantin at bedtime for urinary tract infection suppression. Patient: Okay, I'll make sure to do that. Doctor: And you'll need to follow up with me in ten days for a cystogram and catheter removal. We'll also discuss your office follow-up at that time. Patient: I'll be sure to come in for my follow-up appointment. Doctor: Good. I'm glad we were able to get this all taken care of. If you have any questions or concerns in the meantime, please don't hesitate to call my office. Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help.\",\n          \"doctor: Good morning, patient. I see you're here for a follow-up appointment. How are you feeling today? patient: I'm doing okay. I've been having some problems with my stomach and bowels. doctor: Can you tell me more about that? patient: Well, I've been having a lot of heartburn and indigestion. I also get nauseous and belch a lot.

The trouble swallowing started a few years ago. doctor: Have you noticed any other changes in your bowel habits? patient: Yes, I have. I've been alternating between constipation and diarrhea for the past several years. I also get some lower abdominal cramping and discomfort, especially when I'm constipated. doctor: Do you take any medications for these problems? patient: Yes, I take a lot of medications. I take Tramadol, hydrocodone, zolpidem, triamterene, atenolol, vitamin D, TriCor, simvastatin, ibuprofen, and Lyrica. doctor: I see. Well, I think we need to do some tests to figure out what's causing your problems. I'd like to order an upper endoscopy and a colonoscopy. patient: What are those? doctor: An upper endoscopy is a procedure where we insert a thin tube with a camera on the end down your throat to look at your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. A colonoscopy is a procedure where we insert a thin tube with a camera on the end into your rectum to look at your colon. patient: Okay. And what if they find something? doctor: If we find anything abnormal, we can take a biopsy to test it. patient: I see. Well, I guess I'll do it. doctor: Okay. I'll also prescribe some medications to help with your heartburn and indigestion. patient: Thank you. doctor: You're welcome. I'll see you back in a few weeks to go over the results of your tests. patient: Okay.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"note\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1102,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Weakness on right side and difficulty speaking.

Thank you for coming in today. I understand you've been experiencing some confusion and had a stroke. patient: Yes, that's right. I'm not sure why I'm here, but I had a stroke. doctor: I see. Well, let's start by going over your medical history. You have a history of coronary artery disease and had bypass grafting surgery in the past. Do you remember when and where that was? patient: I'm not sure. I don't remember much about it. doctor: That's okay. We can look that up in your chart. It also says here that you have carotid artery stenosis and had right carotid artery stenting. Again, do you recall when that was? patient: No, I don't remember that either. doctor: No problem. Additionally, you have diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a history of stroke with left-sided hemiplegia. patient: Yes, I remember having a stroke. doctor: I understand. Now, let's talk about your current symptoms. You mentioned confusion. Can you tell me more about that? patient: Well, I've been feeling disoriented and forgetful. I also had trouble speaking and understanding others. doctor: I see. And have you experienced any chest discomfort, shortness of breath, or palpitations? patient: No, I haven't had any of those symptoms. doctor: That's good to hear. I've reviewed your EKG and telemetry results. It shows that you have atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. However, your current telemetry shows normal sinus rhythm. patient: What does that mean? doctor: Atrial fibrillation is a heart rhythm disorder where the upper chambers of your heart (the atria) beat irregularly and rapidly. This can lead to a rapid heart rate and an increased risk of stroke. patient: That sounds serious. doctor: It can be, but we're going to take steps to manage it. I've consulted with cardiology, and we recommend starting you on Coumadin to prevent further strokes. However, given your current neurological status, we need to assess your risk of falling. If the risk is low, we'll proceed with Coumadin. Otherwise, we'll consider aspirin and Plavix. patient: I understand. doctor: Additionally, you have carotid artery stenosis. We'll order a CT angio of the carotid to assess stent patency. However, given your recent stroke, revascularization is not indicated at this time. patient: Okay. doctor: Finally, you have coronary artery disease, but you're clinically stable. We'll monitor that closely. patient: Thank you for explaining everything to me. doctor: You're welcome. We'll continue to monitor your condition and make any necessary adjustments to your treatment plan.\",\n          \"doctor: Hello, patient. I understand you're here today for foot pain? patient: Yes, that's right. I've been having pain in my foot for a while now, and it's been getting worse lately. doctor: Can you tell me more about the pain? Where exactly is it located? patient: It's on the top and lateral aspect of my foot, below my ankle. It's a sharp, stabbing pain that gets worse when I walk or exercise. doctor: Have you seen a doctor about this pain before? patient: Yes, I saw Dr. XYZ last week for back pain, and he prescribed me some pain medication and muscle relaxers. But I've been in here multiple times for different kinds of pain. doctor: I see. And have you had any recent injuries to your foot? patient: No, I haven't injured it recently. It's just been chronically painful. doctor: I understand. Well, let me take a look at your foot. doctor (after examining the patient's foot): Your foot looks okay. There's no redness, swelling, or warmth. The surgical scars are well-healed. There is some mild tenderness around the medial side of your foot, just below the medial malleolus. patient: Yeah, that's where it hurts the most. doctor: I think the pain you're experiencing is likely due to the hardware in your foot. It's possible that the hardware is causing some irritation or inflammation. patient: So, what can I do about it? doctor: Well, we can try some different things to see what helps. I'm going to prescribe you some Lortab 7.5 to help with the pain. I'm also going to refer you to a specialist who can evaluate your foot and determine if the hardware needs to be removed. patient: Okay, thank you. doctor: You're welcome. I hope this helps. patient: Me too. doctor: I also want to talk to you about your primary care physician. You've been seen here multiple times for pain, and it's important to have a regular doctor who can oversee your care. patient: I know, I've been trying to find one. I was supposed to see Dr. XYZ today, but they canceled my appointment because I don't have Project Access insurance yet. doctor: I see. Well, I'm glad to hear that Project Access will be approving your insurance next week. In the meantime, I'm going to keep your chart open so that we can follow up with you and make sure you're getting the care you need. patient: Thank you, I appreciate that. doctor: You're welcome. I'm here to help.\",\n          \"doctor today i'm seeing christina cooper . her date of birth is 07/01/1954 . uh , ms. cooper is a new patient who was referred by diane nelson for a long-standing iron deficiency anemia . doctor hello , how are you ? patient i'm good , thank you . doctor so tell me what brings you in today . patient recently i tried to donate blood , around december i think , and they told me i was anemic , which is something i've been dealing with for a while , so it's not the first time i've been told i'm anemic . doctor or how have you been feeling in general with this ? patient not great . i have been feeling fatigued often during the day , and even feverish with chills at times . when i try to be active i like i ca n't catch my breath and i feel like i'm wheezing . i've had some headaches too , which is not like me . doctor okay . are there any other symptoms ? patient i've been noting some chilling sensations . i also get cold so easily . it's annoying . i feel like i have to really bundle up . i do n't know if this is related but my anxiety and depression feel like it has been getting worse lately . i feel like a mess . doctor sounds like you're not feeling great , obviously . and i'm glad you came to see us . um , we're certainly going to try to figure this out and figure out what's going on , uh , but it sounds like you've been dealing with this anemia for a long time ? patient yeah , i've been anemic since i was 13 years old . doctor right . so why do your doctors think you're anemic ? do you have a history of heavy periods ? patient well i did have heavy periods until i had a hysterectomy in 1996 . but no , they have not told me why they think i'm anemic , which is frustrating honestly . doctor yeah . i can imagine that is . um , let's see if we can help though . since you had your hysterectomy your periods , of course , are no longer the issue . um , when was your last colonoscopy ? patient about five to six years ago . doctor and was it relatively a normal exam ? did you have any polyps ? patient no . they said they'd see me in 10 years . doctor well that's good news . patient yeah , i agree . doctor um , do you have a pacemaker or defibrillator , or have sleep apnea , or use oxygen at night ? patient no . doctor all right . do you ever drink alcohol ? patient yeah , but only once or twice a year . doctor okay . are you taking any supplements such as iron or vitamin b12 ? patient i already started taking my iron pills which i have not taken in about a year . doctor all right . and what are you taking ? patient i'm taking 25 milligram tablets , twice daily . doctor okay , and that's the , the ferrous sulfate ? patient yeah , that's it . i take one in the morning and one in the evening . doctor okay . anything else ?

patient no . doctor okay . you can sit up . so your physical exam is normal without any significant findings . all right ms. cooper , often when we initially see anemia and your host of symptoms , we suspect internal bleeding . patient is that why they want me to have another upper endoscopy ? doctor actually it would be an upper endoscopy and a colonoscopy , but yes , likely that's the reason why . patient lovely . doctor yeah . unfortunately our cameras do not meet all the way in the middle , so if those tests back , come , if those tests come back fine , then we'll have you swallow a pill camera to take pictures as it moves through your , uh , system . patient okay . doctor we may not need to , but it's just the first thing we can do to make sure that you're not losing blood . um , the second thing we can do is have you see a hematologist . they will tell us if you need to give any , to give you any intravenous iron , or maybe something to help your body store the iron better . patient all right . doctor so let's go ahead , get your upper endoscopy and colonoscopy scheduled . patient okay . doctor um , have you ever had any issue with sedation in the past ? patient no , i was just sleepy afterwards . doctor okay . well we will give you a bowel prep to clean out your bowels ahead of time . um , if we do these tests and they are normal , like i said , then we will consider that capsule endoscopy . patient okay . sounds like a plan . doctor all right . so after that you'll be all done and we will send you to the hematologist . additionally , i'm going to need you to start taking your iron pills with orange juice . uh , the vitamin c will help you absorb the iron better . do this for about 8-12 weeks , uh , and then we can reassess your blood work . patient okay , that sounds great . doctor all right . well i think we have our plan . on your way out , stop by and schedule your upper endoscopy and c- colonoscopy . uh , we will send a referral to dr. flores who is is the hematologist , so schedule that appointment . um , here are your instructions for the pre- uh , the bowel prep . uh , call us if you have any questions or worsening symptoms . we'll be happy to help you . patient thank you . doctor you're welcome . have a great day , have a great day ms. cooper . patient you too . doctor all right . this is christina cooper , pleasant 65 year old female who was diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia in 12-2019 , and w- and was unable to donate blood . um , her followup blood work on 01/20/20 was revealed a low hemoglobin , stable hematocrit and normal iron labs , although ferritin was low . um , she was taking ferrous sulfate , three hundred , twenty phil- 25 milligrams by mouth . i've asked her to continue each dose with vitamin c found in orange juice , for the next 12 weeks , then recheck to the cbc , iron , ferritin , b12 , and folate . um , a referral was sent to her hematologist . we will plan for an egd and a colonoscopy to assess for potential sources of anemia or gi bleed . if this is inconclusive , capsule endoscopy will be considered . thanks .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"note\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 180,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Confusion and history of stroke. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a pleasant age-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of confusion and history of stroke. The patient reports feeling disoriented and forgetful. She also had trouble speaking and understanding others. She denies chest discomfort, shortness of breath, or palpitations. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and had bypass grafting surgery in the past. She also has carotid artery stenosis and had right carotid artery stenting. Additionally, she has diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a history of stroke with left-sided hemiplegia. The patient's EKG and telemetry results show atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. However, her current telemetry shows normal sinus rhythm. The patient has carotid artery stenosis. A CT angio of the carotid will be ordered to assess stent patency. The patient will be started on Coumadin to prevent further strokes. However, given her current neurological status, the risk of falling will be assessed. If the risk is low, Coumadin will be initiated. Otherwise, aspirin and Plavix will be considered. The patient will be monitored closely for her coronary artery disease. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response Assessment: Atrial fibrillation is a heart rhythm disorder where the upper chambers of the patient's heart (the atria) beat irregularly and rapidly. This can lead to a rapid heart rate and an increased risk of stroke. The patient has a history of stroke, which is a risk factor for developing atrial fibrillation. Plan: - Will consult cardiology. - Will assess patient's risk of falling. - If risk is low, will start Coumadin. If risk is high, will consider aspirin and Plavix. 2. Carotid artery stenosis Assessment: Carotid artery stenosis is a narrowing of the carotid arteries, which are the main arteries that supply blood to the brain. This can increase the risk of stroke. The patient had right carotid artery stenting in the past, but the patency of the stent is unknown. Plan: - Will order CT angio of the carotid to assess stent patency. 3. Coronary artery disease Assessment: Coronary artery disease is a narrowing of the arteries that supply blood to the heart. This can lead to chest pain, shortness of breath, and heart attacks. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and had bypass grafting surgery in the past. He is currently clinically stable. Plan: - Will monitor the patient's condition closely. 4. Left-sided hemiplegia Assessment: Left-sided hemiplegia is a weakness or paralysis of the left side of the body. This is a result of the patient's previous stroke. Plan: - Will continue to monitor the patient's neurological status. - Will provide rehabilitation as needed. Follow-up instructions: - The patient will follow up with cardiology in 1 week.\",\n          \"SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Foot pain.

They're different from the ones he used to have. doctor: In what way? patient: (mother speaks) They're more like tonic spells. He stiffens up and his eyes roll back. He also cries and vomits after some of them. doctor: How often are these seizures happening? patient: (mother speaks) At least multiple times a week. Sometimes he has none for a few days, but then he'll have multiple days in a row with seizures. doctor: I see. And what about his other seizures? The ones he used to have? patient: (mother speaks) He hasn't had any of those in a while. doctor: That's good to hear. Now, I'm going to need to do a physical exam. Is that okay with you? patient: (nods) doctor: (performs physical exam) doctor: Everything looks good. I'm going to admit you to the hospital for a few days so we can do a video EEG. This will help us to capture both types of seizures and figure out what's causing them. patient: (mother speaks) How long will he need to stay in the hospital? doctor: Probably at least 48 to 72 hours. He could be discharged sooner if we capture multiple events. patient: (mother speaks) Okay. doctor: We'll also need to adjust his medications. We'll continue his current dose of Zonegran and Lamictal for now. These medications are very long-acting, and discontinuing them while he's in the hospital may simply result in severe seizures after discharge. patient: (mother speaks) I understand. doctor: I know this is a lot to take in.

We'll do everything we can to get patient feeling better. patient: (mother speaks) Thank you.\",\n          \"doctor: Hello patient, how are you doing today? patient: I'm not doing too well, doctor. I've been having these episodes where my face feels like it's going to twitch. I can usually suppress it by grimacing, but it's still really annoying. doctor: I see. And how often do these episodes happen? patient: It used to be several times a day, but now it's down to maybe once a week. doctor: That's good to hear. It sounds like it's improving. patient: Yeah, a little bit. But I'm still having this weird pressure-like sensation in the right side of my head. It feels like tingling, and sometimes it feels like water is running down my hair. doctor: Interesting. And how often does that happen? patient: It's also decreased in frequency. It used to be every day, but now it's about once a week. And it usually goes away if I take some Aleve. doctor: Okay, that's helpful to know. Now, I understand you're also having some problems with sleepiness and fatigue. Can you tell me more about that? patient: Yes, I'm always tired. I have trouble falling asleep at night, even though I work from 4 pm to midnight. When I finally do fall asleep, I wake up by 9 am and can't get back to sleep. I usually only get about five or six hours of sleep a night. doctor: I see. And do you have any other symptoms, like snoring or gasping for breath at night? patient: I think I might snore, but I'm not sure. I don't remember waking up gasping for breath. doctor: Okay. Well, I've reviewed your medical history and your recent MRI results. The MRI showed a small abnormality in your right clivus and petrous carotid canal, but it's not clear what it is. It's unlikely to be related to your facial twitching or your headache. patient: That's a relief. doctor: I think the best course of action for now is to continue observing your symptoms. We can repeat the MRI in four months to see if there's any change. In the meantime, let's focus on addressing your sleep problems. patient: Okay. What can I do about that? doctor: Well, first, we need to try to get you on a more regular sleep schedule. Try going to bed later, at least 10 pm or 10:30 pm, so that you can get a full night's sleep. We can also talk about weight loss and exercise, which can also help improve sleep quality. patient: I'll try that. doctor: Great. I'm also going to recommend a sleep study to rule out obstructive sleep apnea. patient: Okay. doctor: We'll follow up in five months to see how you're doing. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen or you have any new concerns, please don't hesitate to call my office. patient: Thank you, doctor.

They can help to stabilize your mood and prevent these manic episodes. patient: I know, but I just don't like the way they make me feel. They make me feel tired and groggy. doctor: I understand that. But the benefits of taking your medications outweigh the risks. They can help to prevent you from harming yourself or others. patient: I guess you're right. I'll start taking them again. doctor: That's good to hear. I'm also going to prescribe you a new medication called Abilify. It can help to reduce the symptoms of mania. patient: Okay. doctor: I'm also going to recommend that you see a therapist. They can help you to learn how to manage your symptoms and cope with stress. patient: I'm not sure I want to see a therapist. doctor: I understand that. But it's important to get help. A therapist can help you to get your life back on track. patient: I'll think about it. doctor: Okay. In the meantime, I'm going to keep you here in the hospital for observation. We'll monitor your symptoms and make sure you're safe. patient: Okay. doctor: I'm also going to order some blood tests to make sure there's nothing else going on that could be causing your symptoms. patient: Okay. doctor: I'll be back to check on you later. patient: Okay. doctor: (to the nurse) Please make sure the patient takes her medications as prescribed.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a young male who presents to the clinic with his mother for evaluation of new onset tonic seizures. The patient's mother reports that he has been having seizures more frequently, at least multiple times a week, sometimes with multiple days in a row with seizures. She describes these new seizures as tonic spells, with stiffening and eye rolling, as well as crying and vomiting after some of them. The patient has not had any of his typical seizures for some time. The patient is currently taking Zonegran and Lamictal for his seizures. His mother understands that these medications will be continued at his current dose during his hospitalization. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. Complex partial seizures and new-onset tonic seizures Assessment: The patient has a history of complex partial seizures that have recently become more frequent and severe. He is also experiencing new-onset tonic seizures. These seizures are characterized by stiffening, eye rolling back, crying, and vomiting. The patient's current anticonvulsant medications are not adequately controlling his seizures. Plan: - Admit to the hospital for video EEG monitoring and medication adjustment. - Continue Zonegran and Lamictal at current doses. - Consider adding a third anticonvulsant medication, such as levetiracetam or topiramate. - Work with neurology for further management. Follow-up instructions: - The patient will be followed closely in the hospital. Once his seizures are under control, he will be discharged home with instructions to follow up with his neurologist in 1 week.\",\n          \"SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Facial twitching and headache. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a pleasant age-year-old male who presents today for evaluation of facial twitching and headache.

She tried physical therapy without benefit and ultimately came to a subacromion decompression in November 2002. She had ongoing pain and was evaluated by Dr. X who felt that she had a possible brachial plexopathy. He also felt she had a right superficial radial neuritis and blocked this with resolution of her symptoms. He then referred her to ABCD who did EMG testing, demonstrating a right suprascapular neuropathy although a C5 radiculopathy could not be ruled out. MRI testing on the cervical spine was then done which was negative for disk herniation and she underwent suprascapular nerve decompression of the scapular notch on 12/18/03. She finally went to an anterior axillary nerve block because of ongoing pain in the anterior shoulder again by Dr. X. She comes to me for impairment rating.
