"Doctor: Good afternoon, who's the victim today, sir? Is it you, or your daughter? Guest_family: Good afternoon, doctor. It's my daughter today. Doctor: Remind me, how old is she? Patient: I'm thirteen, sir. Doctor: So, what happened? My nurses tell me she fell today. Patient: Yeah, I fell off the swing at school earlier this afternoon at about one thirty. Doctor: Where does it hurt, young lady? Patient: It's really bad here on my left elbow. Doctor: Which hand do you write with? Patient: I use my right hand for everything, thank goodness for that. Doctor: Before seeing me, have you seen anyone else? Guest_family: Yeah, we went to an Urgent Care and she had an x ray there. Doctor: What else did they do? Guest_family: They said her arm was broken, and they tried to do a reduction. Doctor: Do you have those x rays with you right now? Guest_family: Yeah, I have them right here, take a look, please. Doctor: Well, these x rays show an incarcerated medial epicondyle fracture, as well as a mildly angulated radial shaft break. Patient: What does that mean? Doctor: Well, in short, you broke the inside part of your elbow. In addition to the pain, do you have any burning or tingling feelings in that arm? Patient: Yes, I do. Doctor: Did you have this before they tried to do a reduction? Patient: No, I didn't, this is new. Doctor: Is this feeling getting worse? Patient: Yes, it is. Doctor: Okay, guys, there is a lot of pressure on that ulnar nerve because of the break and the attempted reduction. Guest_family: What should we do? Doctor: We need to do an O R I F procedure A S A P. I'll reduce that radial shaft fracture at the same time. Guest_family: O R I F? What's that Doctor: I'll put some pins in the elbow, in order to stabilize the break, and we can start the healing process. Guest_family: Will this not heal on its own? Doctor: No, we need to do the surgery. Guest_family: Okay, what are the risks of infection with the surgery? Doctor: Historically, its less than one percent. Guest_family: How is this possible? Doctor: We use prophylactic antibiotics, this helps us control for infection the entire time. Guest_family: Will she be asleep for this? Doctor: Yes, she won't feel a thing. Guest_family: Will she need this hardware taken out in the future? Doctor: Yes, in about a year or two, after everything is healed up nicely. The other risks include bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, and hardware failure. I see good results from my surgeries so I would not worry about these things, but I must disclose. Guest_family: Okay, yes, we'd like to do the surgery.","The patient is a 13-year-old right-hand dominant girl, who fell off a swing at school around 1:30 today. The patient was initially seen at an outside facility and brought here by her father, given findings on x-ray, a closed reduction was attempted on the left elbow. After the attempted reduction, the patient was noted to have an incarcerated medial epicondyle fracture as well as increasing ulnar paresthesias that were not present prior to the procedure. Given this finding, the patient needed urgent open reduction and internal fixation to relieve the pressure on the ulnar nerve. At that same time, the patient's mildly angulated radial shaft fracture will be reduced. This was explained to the father. The risks of surgery included the risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, need for later hardware removal, and possible continuous nerve symptoms. All questions were answered. The father agreed to the above plan.","The patient has a medial epicondyle fracture, a mildly angulated radial shaft fracture, and an incarcerated medial epidermis fracture. The patient is a thirteen year old female. She fell off a swing at school. She had an x-ray at an Urgent Care, and the x-rays showed that she had a radial shaft break. She was not able to do a reduction of the radial shaft, and she was unable to do an O R I F procedure. She did not have an ulnar nerve reduction. She has a moderate medial epiconyle fracture. She is currently in the ER, and has not been seen by a doctor since the fall. She does not have any other symptoms of pain. She will be asleep for this procedure, and will not require any sedation or sedation prior to the surgery. The surgery will be performed at the same time as the patient is asleep for the surgery, in order to stabilize the break, and we can start the healing process. The surgeon will not place any pins in the elbow, and he will not attempt to do any reduction. He will place some pins in her elbow to stabilize it, and place a pin in her radial shaft. The pin will be placed at the radial end of the elbow. The pins will be inserted in the radial part of her elbow, which is located at the ulnar end of her left elbow. This is the location where she fell off the swing at the school. The break is located on the left elbow of the left side of the arm. The radial shaft is located in the medial axis of the right elbow. There is no evidence of a radial fracture. There are no signs of pressure on the radial axis, and there is no sensation of pressure or tingling in that area of the forearm. The elbow is in the middle of her arm, and it is not affected by any other injuries. It is believed that she has a minor epidermolysis bullosa fracture. It has been described as a mildly acute epicondylal fracture, with a medial medial epididymis fracture, as well as a moderately angulated fracture. Patient: What does that mean? Doctor: Well, in short, you broke the inside part of your elbow. Doctor: Do you have those x rays with you right now?

Doctor: Oh no, how long has this knee been hurting you? Patient: Well, since the fall of two thousand seven. Doctor: Have you seen another doctor for this? Patient: Mom, can you tell the doctor? Guest_family: Yes, actually, we went to another orthopedist in November of two thousand seven. Doctor: I see, and what did this doctor recommend? Guest_family: We got an MRI, I have a disc with the images, and the report as well right here, if you want to take a look at it. Doctor: Thank you, yes, so this shows left patellar chondromalacia.

The majority of my patients get significantly better by just going to P T. Guest_family: Is there any surgery to fix this? Doctor: Usually, we manage this for six months without surgery, and she hasn't reached that milestone yet. But, because her pain is getting so severe, I can do a lateral capsular release on this knee. Guest_family: What is that? Doctor: It's a small procedure, minimally invasive, and we can do it outpatient. Her kneecap is partially dislocating, so this surgery will get everything back into alignment.

It was explained to the mother in detail that this is a difficult problem to treat although majority of the patients get better with physical therapy. Her failure with nonoperative treatment is below the standard 6-month trial; however, given her symptoms and severe pain, lateral capsular release was offered. Risk and benefits of surgery were discussed. Risks of surgery including risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion extremity, failure of procedure to relieve pain, need for postoperative rehab, and significant postoperative swelling. All questions were answered, and mother and daughter agreed to the above plans.","The patient has a left patellar chondromalacia. She is in a lot of pain, and has been wearing a brace.

She did, however, receive a referral from another orthopaedic surgeon in November of three thousand seven.

"Doctor: Hello, miss. What brings you into our clinic today? Also, before we start, it looks like you forgot to fill out your ethnicity on the new patient paperwork. Do you mind telling me what you identify as? Patient: Hello, doctor. I am white and I am a young sixty two years old. I have a list of issues I would like to talk about. Doctor: Let's begin. I know that you have been dealing with hypertension and lipometabolism disorder. Doctor X Y Z and I follow you on the hypertension. What else do we have going on? Patient: First off I have a history of diabetes in my family. My father had it and my brother has it currently. I am afraid because I know I have gained some weight. My knee also has been hurting for a long time. The left knee. Doctor: Can you locate where the pain is? Patient: I think it is everywhere in the knee. It hurts to kneel. I had imaging done on it a while ago. Can you check to see the results? Doctor: Ah, yes. We have on file that you had an X Ray done in nineteen ninety nine. I see that a joint is narrowing. We can talk about possible surgery. Patient: Can I have it x rayed again? I don't want any surgery, but I want to know what is going on. I am afraid of surgery. Doctor: Let's see what else I can do. Any other issues? Patient: Yes. I am very concerned because my poop is baby yellow and I have some rectal bleeding occasionally. It is always bright red and drips into the toilet. My last colonoscopy was in nineteen ninety nine. Doctor: Do you have any history of colon cancer? Patient: I do not, but I think my mother did. She is gone now, so I cannot check. Do you think my poop is baby yellow because of my stomach pain? I have some stomach pain and have been laying off the fast food and soda, but it doesn't seem to work. Sometimes my poop is hard or runny. It is always random. Doctor: Do you bleed when the stool is hard? Patient: Not really. Oh, and lastly, I had cold symptoms. Like a sore throat and I was sneezing a lot. I think it was a cold or flu because Claritin did not work. I think the body aches were also from this illness. I feel okay today, but I wanted to bring this up just in case it had to do with my stool being discolored. During this sick period I also am wondering if I have sleep apnea because I wake up in the middle of the night randomly. Doctor: Do you snore? That is a sign of sleep apnea. Smoking also can contribute to restlessness. Patient: No I do not snore and I do not smoke.","The patient is a 62-year-old white female with multiple chronic problems including hypertension and a lipometabolism disorder. She follows with Dr. XYZ on her hypertension, as well as myself. She continues to gain weight. Diabetes is therefore a major concern. In fact, her dad had diabetes and she has a brother who has diabetes. The patient also has several additional concerns she brings up today. One is that her left knee continues to bother her and it hurts. She cannot really isolate where the pain is, it just seems to hurt through her knee. She has had this for some time now and in fact as we reviewed her records, her left knee has been x-rayed in 1999. There was some minimal narrowing of the weightbearing joint with some minor hypertrophic spurring medially. She would like to have this x-rayed again today. She is certainly not interested in any surgery. She has noted that it particularly hurts to kneel. In addition, she complains of her stools being a baby-yellow. She has rectal bleeding off and on. It is bright red. She had a colonoscopy done in 1999. She does have a family history of colon cancer questionable in her mother, who is deceased. She complains of some diffuse abdominal pain off and on. She has given up fast foods and her pop and this has not seemed to help. She does admit however, that she is not eating right. Sometimes her stools are hard. Sometimes they are runny. The blood does not really seem to be related to necessarily a hard stool. It is always bright red and will sometimes drip into the toilet. Over the last couple of days, she had also been sneezing and has had an itchy throat. She tried some Claritin and this did not help. She has had some body aches. She is finally feeling better today with this. She also is questioning whether she has some sleep apnea. She will awaken suddenly in the middle of the night. She was told that she does snore. She does not smoke. As stated, she has gained significant weight.","The patient has a history of diabetes in her family. She has diabetes. She had an X Ray done in nineteen ninety nine.

She would like to have the knee x-rayed again. We can talk about possible surgery. We have on file that you had an x-rays done on your left knee a few years ago. Can you check to see the results? Doctor: Ah, yes. I see that a joint is narrowing. I do not see any narrowing of the knee in the medial meniscus. I am afraid because I know I have gained some weight. I want to know if this is related to the weight gain and if it is not related to weight gain. If it is, we can discuss surgery. If not, we will talk about surgery. Any other issues?

I just wear them when I go to work. I think they're good for heel pain. I'd like to see a doctor to see if anything else is wrong with me. I'm not having any other problems with my feet at all other times. I feel pain in my heels, but it's mostly at my heels. Heel pain is the most common symptom. I've been wearing tennis shoes for the last few years. I have no other symptoms. I would recommend getting orthotic shoes for your heel pain at work and resting them when you go to the office.

"Doctor: I hear someone has a birthday coming up, how old are you turning, ma'am? Patient: I'll be ninety later this month, doctor. Doctor: You're here for a follow up not very long after your first visit. What seems to be the problem today? Patient: Well, actually, my high blood pressure and right arm symptoms are basically gone. Doctor: Great, I saw your blood pressure reading for today, and it's much better. Are you taking the higher dose of Mavik we recommended? Patient: No, I'm not taking that right now. Doctor: How did you tolerate the higher dose? Patient: I didn't feel well at all, so I just went back to the old dose. Doctor: That was one M G per day, correct? Patient: Yes, doctor. I do think I could have some white coat high blood pressure. Doctors' offices make me nervous. Doctor: That does happen. Here, try this sample of Tarka, please. Patient: What is this for, doctor? Doctor: Well, since you're taking the Mavik plus verapamil, you can switch over to Tarka, which is the combined version of the two drugs. Patient: I can't take these, doctor. They're too big. Guest_family: Hello doctor, I'm her daughter. Just so you know, we check her blood pressure at home periodically and it's always similar to that reading. Doctor: Good, so back to that right arm, how is that doing today? Patient: Well, that pain is basically gone now, I think it had to do with that muscle problem back in my right shoulder blade. Doctor: Did you have x rays taken today? Patient: Yes, the tech brought me back right before you came in. Doctor: Good, I have the images right here. Patient: What do they show, doctor? Doctor: Well, these x rays of the neck and right shoulder show some degenerative changes, and possibly some kind of rotator cuff injury. Patient: What makes you think there's an injury? Doctor: Well, look right here. The humeral head is pretty high in the glenoid in the right shoulder, but do you have any pain here? Patient: No, none. Doctor: Then we won't worry about it. Patient: I am having this stomach pain though, doctor. Doctor: How has this pain developed and progressed recently? Patient: Well, it's improved somewhat with me not taking Aleve anymore. Doctor: What medicines are you taking right now, then? Patient: Right know, I'm just taking Tylenol as needed. That seems to be enough for me. Doctor: Do you think this could be acid reflux, or heartburn? Patient: No, but I take Tums, um, three times a day, and Mylanta at night. Oh yeah, I have these sores in my mouth, can you take a look? Doctor: I see. How long have you worn dentures? Patient: Oh I couldn't even tell you, it's been many, many years. Doctor: Do they come and go, the sores? Patient: Yes, one will come, then it'll heal up, then another. Doctor: Okay, we'll keep an eye on it. Patient: And doctor, since I've been taking the Lexapro, I have some tremors on basically my whole body, at least the upper body, like my torso and arms. Doctor: It's hard to tell if you have a tremor today, ma'am, but do you think the Lexapro is helping otherwise? Patient: Yes, we think so.","The patient is an 89-year-old lady. She actually turns 90 later this month, seen today for a short-term followup. Actually, the main reasons we are seeing her back so soon which are elevated blood pressure and her right arm symptoms are basically resolved. Blood pressure is better even though she is not currently on the higher dose Mavik likely recommended. She apparently did not feel well with the higher dose, so she just went back to her previous dose of 1 mg daily. She thinks, she also has an element of office hypertension. Also, since she is on Mavik plus verapamil, she could switch over to the combined drug Tarka. However, when we gave her samples of that she thought they were too big for her to swallow. Basically, she is just back on her previous blood pressure regimen. However, her blood pressure seems to be better today. Her daughter says that they do check it periodically and it is similar to today's reading. Her right arm symptoms are basically resolved and she attributed that to her muscle problem back in the right shoulder blade. We did do a C-spine and right shoulder x-ray and those just mainly showed some degenerative changes and possibly some rotator cuff injury with the humeral head quite high up in the glenoid in the right shoulder, but this does not seem to cause her any problems. She has some vague 'stomach problems', although apparently it is improved when she stopped Aleve and she does not have any more aches or pains off Aleve. She takes Tylenol p.r.n., which seems to be enough for her. She does not think she has any acid reflux symptoms or heartburn. She does take Tums t.i.d. and also Mylanta at night. She has had dentures for many, many years and just recently I guess in the last few months, although she was somewhat vague on this, she has had some sores in her mouth. They do heal up, but then she will get another one. She also thinks since she has been on the Lexapro, she has somewhat of a tremor of her basically whole body at least upper body including the torso and arms and had all of the daughters who I not noticed to speak of and it is certainly difficult to tell her today that she has much tremor. They do think the Lexapro has helped to some extent.","Dentures. How long have you worn dentures? Patient: Oh I couldn't even tell you, it's been many, many years. Doctor: You're here for a follow up not very long after your first visit. Are you taking the higher dose of Mavik we recommended. Patient: No, I'm not taking that right now. I do think I could have some white coat high blood pressure. What seems to be the problem today, ma'am, but do you think the lower dose of Lexapro is helping with that. I don't think so. I've been taking it for a couple of weeks now, and it's much better. I think it had to do with that muscle problem back in my right shoulder blade. I have some degenerative changes, and possibly some kind of rotator cuff injury. The humeral head is pretty high in the glenoid in the right shoulder, but there's no pain here. I also have some pain in my neck and right shoulder. I'm taking Tylenol as needed, and Aleve as needed. I am not taking Aleve anymore, and I am taking Tums, um, three times a day, and Mylanta at night. I take Tums for stomach pain, and Tums at night for acid reflux. That seems to have improved somewhat, but I am having this stomach pain though, with Aleve, and the Tums are not helping with the stomach pain. The Tums do not seem to be helping with this, and my stomach pain has improved somewhat with the Tarka. Here, try this sample of Tarkas. It seems to help with the pain, but it is not helping the pain with the Aleve. The Aleve does not help with this pain. It has improved with Tums. The tarka is helping. I can't take the tarkas, though. They're too big. I cannot take the Tarts, and they are too big for me to take. I use Tums and Mylaranta, and also Tums as needed for my stomach. The pain is not improving with the tums and Tarts. The only other thing I have been taking is the Mavick, and that's been working very well for me. I did not take it for more than a month. I took it for about a month and a half, and did not feel well at all, so I just went back to the old"

"Doctor: Hello, ma'am. What is the reason for your visit today? Patient: I was referred by a doctor to come see you so that you could check up on my nasal problems. Here is my report from my previous doctor who referred me to you. Doctor: Thank you. Let me take a look. I see here it says you had severe sinusitis two to three months ago, correct? Patient: Is that what they're calling my nasal problems? Doctor: Yeah, it is. Sinusitis is the inflammation of your nasal airways. Patient: I see. Thank you for describing it to me. Doctor: No problem. Would you be able to describe to me what you had been feeling two to three months ago? Patient: Yeah, I can. My face would feel uncomfortable, my nose was stuffy, my eyes hurt, and I felt something dropping in the back of my throat. Doctor: Have you ever been prescribed any medication? Patient: Here's the list of medicine I was taking. Doctor: I see you were given antibiotics, correct? Patient: I was, but I don't know what those are. Could you explain them to me? Doctor: Antibiotics are usually used to fight infections. Patient: I had an infection? I thought I just had some nasal problems. Doctor: Your report states you had a severe infection. Do you remember if the antibiotics helped? Patient: Not really. I felt like my symptoms were the same. Doctor: I see. Did your doctor order any advanced imaging's? Patient: Yeah. They did a C T scan of my nose. Here is the report from my C T scan. Doctor: Let me take a look. It looks like you had some thickening of the mucosal layer in your right paranasal sinus. You also had some obstruction in your right ostiomeatal complex and excess growing of some of the bones in your nose. Uhm. Oh, one more thing. I see your nasal septum was shifted to the left. Patient: Oh, wow. Thank you for explaining everything to me. Doctor: No problem. Going back to your list of medications, I know you took antibiotics for your infection, but did you take any medication for your sinuses? Patient: No, I haven't. I did try this cream for my nose, but that didn't work either. Nothing worked! Doctor: I see. Looks like the cream you used was a topical nasal corticosteroid. Are there any other symptoms that you have been experiencing? Patient: I've had some trouble with my balance, and I feel like I've lost some of my hearing. I thought this was odd since I'm only fifty years old. I think my ears felt plugged or full of air, so they just needed to pop. Doctor: I see. Let's perform an audiogram test to check your ears. Patient: Sounds good. Doctor: I'm seeing that you have some mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Your tympanometry seems to be normal. Your speech discrimination was also normal. Patient: That's reassuring. Doctor: I want to ask a few more questions about your ears. Do you feel any fullness or pressure? Patient: No, I don't feel anything like that right now. Doctor: Do you hear any humming, buzzing, or roaring sounds? Patient: Nope. I don't hear anything like that. Doctor: We checked your ears and now understand more about the problem, but I wonder why your balance is affected. When did you start noticing your balance was affected? Patient: I think it could have been to this one medicine that starts with an A. I forgot the name, but it didn't really help my nasal problems. It just made my balance worse. Doctor: Was the medicine called Allegra? Patient: Oh, yeah. That's what it was called. I thought I had some sort of allergy, so I thought it would help. Doctor: I see. Did you ever feel any dizziness too? Patient: Yeah, I did. Doctor: I will have you do some movements to see if your dizziness occurs. Patient: Sounds good. Doctor: Could you look to the left and then look to the right. Patient: Oh, wow. That made me very dizzy. Doctor: Looks like sudden movements and head turning make your dizziness worse.","I had the pleasure of meeting and evaluating the patient referred today for evaluation and treatment of chronic sinusitis. As you are well aware, she is a pleasant 50-year-old female who states she started having severe sinusitis about two to three months ago with facial discomfort, nasal congestion, eye pain, and postnasal drip symptoms. She states she really has sinus problems, but this infection has been rather severe and she notes she has not had much improvement with antibiotics. She had a CT of her paranasal sinuses identifying mild mucosal thickening of right paranasal sinuses with occlusion of the ostiomeatal complex on the right and turbinate hypertrophy was also noted when I reviewed the films and there is some minimal nasal septum deviation to the left. She currently is not taking any medication for her sinuses. She also has noted that she is having some problems with her balance and possible hearing loss or at least ear popping and fullness. Her audiogram today demonstrated mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss, normal tympanometry, and normal speech discrimination. She has tried topical nasal corticosteroid therapy without much improvement. She tried Allegra without much improvement and she believes the Allegra may have caused problems with balance to worsen. She notes her dizziness to be much worse if she does quick positional changes such as head turning or sudden movements, no ear fullness, pressure, humming, buzzing or roaring noted in her ears. She denies any previous history of sinus surgery or nasal injury. She believes she has some degree of allergy symptoms.","I had a severe sinus infection two to three months ago.

I feel like my sinus was inflamed. I've been taking some antibiotics for the last two months, but nothing has helped. I am not taking any other than a topical corticostomy cream. I don’t think it has helped me. I do not think I have any other symptoms other than the nasal problems I had. I see you were given antibiotics, correct? I was. It did not help me at all for the past two months. I only took one of the antibiotics I was taking. It wasn't effective at all, so I stopped taking it. I'm not sure if it was the antibiotics that caused the problem, but the other medications did not seem to be effective. It seems that you had some thickening of the mucosal layer in your right paranasal sinus. You also had some obstruction in your nasal septum and excess growing of some of the bones in your nose. Your sinuses were shifted to the left. You had some inflammation of your nasal airways. You were also having some inflammation in your sinus"

Patient: Well, I did a quiz online on the Cialis website and I didn't score in the normal range, so I figured I would come in. Doctor: Is there anything else of note, sir?

Doctor: Okay, do you have any significant medical conditions in the past that you have been treated for? Patient: No, not that I know of. Doctor: What about testicular infections?
