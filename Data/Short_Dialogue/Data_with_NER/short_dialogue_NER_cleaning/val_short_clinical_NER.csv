Sometimes he even forgets his name. Patient: He's kidding. I know my name. I also know his kids' names. I do agree that sometimes I forget my things or feel lost. Doctor: I don't blame you. I forget my things at my age. Guest_family: Yeah, it is something like episodic that he forgets everything and sometimes he's absolutely normal. On good days, he's very nice to talk to. Doctor: What is his living status? Guest_family: He lives at a board and care. It is a cozier homelike place. Doctor: That's good. So what brings you here in the emergency today? Guest_family: He started complaining of stomach aches. Luckily, I was there. It was very sudden at one moment he was talking to me nicely and then all of a sudden he started complaining of severe pain in his stomach area. That's when I decided to bring him here in the emergency room. Doctor: Do you have any previous reports? Patient: I have these reports. Doctor: Do you remember when was this scan done?

When we asked him about other symptoms, he said, it's hard to urinate and it is painful. Nausea and vomiting are something that I am not sure about. He was normally rushing to the restroom and every time used to say he didn't want to pee as it hurt him. He also had a few accidents in the last few days where he wet himself.

GENHX,"The patient returns today for a followup. She was recently in the hospital and was found to be septic from nephrolithiasis. This was all treated. She did require a stent in the left ureter. Dr. XYZ took care of this. She had a stone, which was treated with lithotripsy. She is now back here for followup. I had written out all of her medications with their dose and schedule on a progress sheet. I had given her instructions regarding follow up here and follow with Dr. F. Unfortunately, that piece of paper was lost. Somehow between the hospital and home she lost it and has not been able to find it. She has no followup appointment with Dr. F. The day after she was dismissed, her nephew called me stating that the prescriptions were lost, instructions were lost, etc. Later she apparently found the prescriptions and they were filled. She tells me she is taking the antibiotic, which I believe was Levaquin and she has one more to take. She had no clue as to seeing Dr. XYZ again. She says she is still not feeling very well and feels somewhat sick like. She has no clue as to still having a ureteral stent. I explained this to she and her husband again today.","Doctor: Good morning. So, you are here for your follow up today. Patient: Yes, sir. Doctor: Update me what happened, why were you in the hospital? Patient: I had a lot of back pain and less of urine output. I always had burning sensation whenever I used to go to the bathroom. So, I went to the doctor, and they said it is kidney stones. I knew something was wrong, but then I started having fever. So, I went to the hospital and they said that it was infection. It all began with my kidney stones. Doctor: I see. So how are you feeling now? Patient: I'm feeling better. The burning sensation is gone. Pain has subsided. Doctor: It says that they put a stent in your ureter. Are you feeling any discomfort with it? Who was your doctor there? Patient: No discomfort, I'm just here for my follow up. Doctor X Y Z did operate on me to remove all those stones, the kidney stones. She is a good doctor. She did take care of me. I feel all new now. Doctor: That's nice to hear. I'm glad you are feeling okay. You remember I wrote down all the medications with their doses on your progress note, a sheet that we gave to you. Your nephew called me and he said that the prescription was lost and instructions were lost. What happened there? Patient: I don't know. I remember you gave me a paper saying it has all the medicines. It's everything related to them and all the things that I have to do. But I don't know what happened between the hospital and the home. I completely lost it. And I don't know where did it go. Doctor: It had instructions to follow up here and also to follow up with Doctor F. Do you have an appointment with Doctor F? You never did call me after the day you were dismissed from the hospital saying that you might have lost the paper that we gave to you. Patient: No, unfortunately I don't have any appointment with Doctor F. I was not even aware about that, that I have to take an appointment because maybe it was only there in the paper. It completely got out of my mind. Somehow, I did find the prescription paper where all the medicines were and I was able to get them filled and I was taking all my antibiotics and everything else which was there.

She needs to take her medicines and make her appointment with Doctor F. Also, she does need to see if Doctor X Y Z needs a follow up. You can call them and ask.

The patient on followup; however, noted to have intraarticular protrusion of her screw. This was not noted intraoperatively on previous fluoroscopic views. Given this finding, I explained to the father and especially the mother that this can cause further joint damage and that the screw would need to be exchanged for a shorter one. Risks and benefits of surgery were discussed. Risks of surgery include risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, failure to remove the screw, possible continued joint stiffness or damage. All questions were answered and parents agreed to above plan.","Doctor: Can you tell me more about your daughter's injury?

So, um, if you look her at the x rays, it appears that the screw is now going into the hip joint. Guest_family: They didn't see that before. What can we do about this? Doctor: We'll need to do another operation in order to remove this screw and put a shorter one in. We need to do the surgery because this can cause further joint damage.

GENHX,"23-year-old Hispanic male who presented for evaluation of chronic abdominal pain. Patient described the pain as dull, achy, constant and located at the epigastric area with some radiation to the back. There are also occasional episodes of stabbing epigastric pain unrelated to meals lasting only minutes. Patient noted that the pain started approximately six months prior to this presentation.
