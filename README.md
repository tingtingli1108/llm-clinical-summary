# Enhancing Medical Dialogue Summarization with Key Word and Medical Entity Extraction
Accurate documentation of patient-clinician interactions is essential for high-quality healthcare. The increasing volume of medical dialogues necessitates efficient systems to generate precise and coherent summaries, relieving clinicians from the burden of extensive note taking. This project explores enhancing medical dialogue summarization through keyword and medical entity extraction. We utilize the MTS-Dialog dataset for short dialogues and the ACI Bench and Dialogue_G for long dialogues, comparing Bio-BERT, Medical NER and KeyBERT for keyword and entity extraction. Our summarization approach involves fine-tuning LED_LARGE and Flan-T5. The evaluation metrics include ROUGE Scores and Precision, Recall, and F1 Score. By integrating these techniques, we aim to enhance the presence of critical medical terminology in summaries, thereby improving clinical documentation practices and patient care workflows.
