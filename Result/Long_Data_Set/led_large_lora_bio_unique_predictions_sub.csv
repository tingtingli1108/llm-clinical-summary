"doctor: Good morning, Mr. A. Thank you for coming in today. I understand you're here for a new patient evaluation. patient: That's right. doctor: Can you tell me a little bit about your medical history? patient: Well, I've had two surgeries in the past. The first was in July of 2006, and the second was in August of 2007. After that, I started having seizures and hemiparesis. I've been in and out of the hospital, and I developed C. diff. I'm currently in a nursing home because I'm unable to care for myself. doctor: I see. I've reviewed your medical records, including the information from the nursing home. It looks like you're taking Keppra, Decadron, oxycodone, aspirin, Prilosec, Dilantin, and Flagyl. Is that correct? patient: Yes, that's right. doctor: Okay. I've also reviewed your imaging studies. It shows that you have a malignant meningioma with progression of disease and significant brain edema. patient: What does that mean? doctor: It means that the tumor has grown and is causing swelling in your brain. This is causing your symptoms, such as the seizures, hemiparesis, and confusion. patient: So what can be done about it? doctor: Unfortunately, there are no good treatment options for malignant meningioma. Chemotherapy is an option, but you're not in a condition to receive it. Surgery is another option, but I don't think it would be in your best interest. The likelihood of benefit from surgery is small, and there's a good chance that you wouldn't be able to recover. patient: I don't understand. Why wouldn't surgery help? doctor: Because the tumor is so aggressive, it's likely to come back even after surgery. And the surgery itself is very risky. You could end up with more problems than you have now. patient: So what are my options? doctor: I'm afraid there aren't any good options. The best we can do is try to manage your symptoms and make you as comfortable as possible. patient: That's it? There's nothing else that can be done? doctor: I'm sorry, but that's the reality of the situation. patient: (Silence) doctor: I know this is a lot to take in. I'm here to answer any questions you have. patient: (Silence) doctor: I'm going to give you some information about malignant meningioma and the different treatment options. I'll also give you a referral to a palliative care specialist. They can help you manage your symptoms and provide support to you and your family. patient: Thank you. doctor: You're welcome. I'm here if you need anything else.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT New patient evaluation.

"doctor: Hello, Mr./Ms. patient, thank you for coming in today. I understand you're here for complaints of low back and right thigh pain. patient: That's right, doctor. It's been going on for a while now, and it's really starting to affect my daily life. doctor: I see. Can you tell me a little bit more about the pain? Where exactly do you feel it, and how would you describe it? patient: It's mostly in my lower back, between L4 and the sacrum. It's a sharp, stabbing pain that sometimes radiates down my right thigh. It's been especially bad lately, and I've been having trouble sleeping and working. doctor: I understand. Have you seen a doctor about this before? patient: Yes, I was seen in your clinic on 04/12/05. I was prescribed a Medrol Dosepak, and it helped reduce the pain a bit. But it's still there, and it's still interfering with my life. doctor: I see. Well, let's take a look at your back and see if we can find anything that might be causing the pain. The doctor performs a physical examination of the patient's back. doctor: Your range of motion is limited, and you're tender to palpation. There's no overt muscular spasm, and your reflexes are symmetric. patient: So what does that mean? doctor: Well, it means that there's something going on in your back that's causing the pain. It could be a herniated disc, or it could be something else. We'll need to do some more tests to figure it out. patient: What kind of tests? doctor: We'll start with an MRI. That will give us a detailed look at your spine and help us see what's causing the pain. patient: Okay. And what happens after that? doctor: Once we know what's causing the pain, we can start treating it. We may need to prescribe medication, or we may need to do surgery. But we'll take it one step at a time. patient: I'm glad to hear that. I'm ready to do whatever it takes to get rid of this pain. doctor: I'm glad to hear that. We'll work together to get you feeling better. The doctor and patient discuss the patient's medical history, including his previous back surgeries and his current medications. doctor: Okay, Mr./Ms. patient, I've reviewed your medical history and your test results. I've also examined your back. I believe that you have a herniated disc at L4-L5. This is a condition in which the soft, jelly-like center of an intervertebral disc pushes through the tough outer layer of the disc. This can cause pain, numbness, and weakness in the back and legs. patient: So what can we do about it? doctor: There are a few different treatment options for a herniated disc. We can start with conservative treatment, such as physical therapy and pain medication. If that doesn't help, we may need to consider surgery. patient: I'm not sure I want to have surgery. doctor: I understand. Surgery is always a last resort. But if conservative treatment doesn't help, it may be the best option for you. patient: I'll think about it. doctor: Okay. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a new pain medication. I'm also going to refer you to a physical therapist. patient: Thank you, doctor. doctor: You're welcome. I'm here to help.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Low back and right thigh pain.

"doctor: Hello Mrs./Ms. patient, thank you for coming in today. I understand you're here because of some back pain and right leg pain. Can you tell me a little bit more about that? patient: Sure. I've been having back pain and right leg pain for about two years now. It started after I was diagnosed with small cell lung cancer. The cancer has spread to my femurs, lower lumbar spine, and pelvis. doctor: I see. So, the pain started after your cancer diagnosis and has been ongoing since then? patient: Yes, that's right. I've had numerous chemotherapy and radiation treatments, but the pain hasn't gone away. I just finished a series of 10 radiation treatments for pain relief, but it didn't help much. doctor: I understand. Can you describe the pain in more detail? Where exactly do you feel it, and what does it feel like? patient: The pain is mostly in my low back on the right side. It radiates down the back of my right leg to my knee. I also have some numbness in the bottom of my left foot, and some sharp pain in the left foot at times. The pain is sharp, dull, and aching. It's a 10 out of 10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst possible pain. doctor: Okay, and what makes the pain worse or better? patient: It seems to be worse while sitting in the car for a long time, standing, or walking. doctor: I see. And what medications are you taking for the pain? patient: I'm on Duragesic patch 250 mcg total, Celebrex 200 mg once daily, iron 240 mg twice daily, Paxil 20 mg daily, and Percocet. I don't know the strength of the Percocet, but I take up to eight a day. I'm also on warfarin 1 mg daily to keep my chest port patent, and Neurontin 300 mg three times daily. doctor: Okay, I've made a note of all that. I'd like to do a physical exam now to get a better understanding of your condition. doctor: (performs physical exam) doctor: Based on my examination and your history, I think you have a symptomatic facet and sacroiliac joint syndrome on the right. This is likely causing your back pain and right leg pain. I'd like to inject your right sacroiliac and facet joints under fluoroscopy today. This is a minimally invasive procedure that can help relieve your pain. patient: Okay, I'm willing to try that. doctor: Great. I'll explain the procedure in more detail and get your consent. I'll also ask for a stat protime today since you're on warfarin. We generally don't perform injections while patients are on warfarin, but since you're on a very small dose and have had previous biopsies while on it without any complications, we should be okay. patient: That sounds good. doctor: I've also asked that you stop taking Paxil and start taking Cymbalta instead. Cymbalta is a medication that can help with both depression and pain. I've also asked for an x-ray of your lumbar spine for further evaluation. patient: Okay, I'll do all of that. doctor: Great. I'll see you back in the clinic on Tuesday to follow up.

I've been having this dizziness for a month now, and it's really starting to affect my life. doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about the dizziness? patient: Well, it started about a month ago. I was just getting out of bed one morning, and suddenly I felt like the room was spinning. I had to sit back down and stay in one place for several minutes before it went away. doctor: And has it been happening ever since? patient: Yes, it's been happening almost every day. It usually happens when I get up from bed or a chair, or when I roll over in bed. It also happens sometimes when I look up. doctor: Do you feel like you're going to pass out? patient: Sometimes. It's like I'm going to faint, but then it goes away. doctor: And do you have any other symptoms, like fever, chills, earache, or vision problems? patient: No, I don't have any other symptoms. doctor: Okay.

I'm going to do a neurological exam now. (The doctor performs a neurological exam.) doctor: Your cranial nerves are intact, and your motor and sensory function is normal. However, I did notice that you have some difficulty with your balance and coordination. patient: Yes, I've been having trouble walking lately. I use a walker to get around. doctor: I see. Well, based on your symptoms and the results of my exam, I think you may have a condition called benign positional vertigo (BPPV). BPPV is a common cause of dizziness, and it's usually caused by a problem with the inner ear. patient: What can I do about it? doctor: There are a few things we can do. First, I'm going to prescribe you a medication called Antivert. This medication can help to reduce the dizziness. I'm also going to schedule you for some tests, including a CT scan of your head and an ENG test. These tests will help us to confirm the diagnosis of BPPV and rule out other possible causes of your dizziness. patient: Okay. doctor: I'm also going to recommend that you see a physical therapist. A physical therapist can teach you some exercises that can help to improve your balance and coordination. patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help. doctor: You're welcome.

"doctor: Good morning, Mr. patient, thank you for coming in today. I understand you've been experiencing some heart failure symptoms. Can you tell me more about what you've been feeling? patient: Well, I've been feeling generally okay, but I've been stressed and fatigued. I work hard running three companies, and I've noticed shortness of breath with exertion and occasional shortness of breath at rest. I've also had some PND, but I sleep on one pillow. I don't have any edema now, but I've had some mild leg swelling in the past. I've never had any angina, palpitations, syncope, or near syncope. When I take my pulse, I notice some irregularity. I don't follow any special diet and I don't get regular exercise, although I've recently started walking for half an hour a day. Over the past year, these symptoms have been slowly getting worse. I've also gained about 20 pounds. doctor: I see. Do you have any history of heart failure or other heart problems? patient: No, I don't. doctor: What about your past medical history? Any notable conditions or surgeries? patient: I had a right inguinal hernia repair in 1982 and trauma to my right thumb. I don't have a history of high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, or heart murmur. doctor: Okay. Now, let's talk about your social history. Where do you live, and who do you live with? patient: I live in San Salvador with my wife. I have a lot of stress in my life. I don't smoke, but I do drink. I have a high school education. doctor: And your family history? Any heart conditions or other significant illnesses? patient: My mother is alive at age 89. My father died at 72 of a heart attack. I have two brothers and one sister, all of whom are healthy, although my oldest brother suffered a myocardial infarction. I have three healthy girls and nine healthy grandchildren. doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. I'm going to perform a comprehensive cardiovascular examination now. The doctor performs the examination. doctor: Based on my examination, I've noted a few findings. Your blood pressure is 120/70 in each arm seated, your pulse is 80 beats per minute and regular, and your breathing is 12 times per minute and unlabored. Your heart rhythm is regular, and your first and second heart sounds are normal. However, you do have a fourth heart sound and a soft systolic murmur. Your precordial impulse is enlarged. Your lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion, and your abdomen is soft without hepatosplenomegaly or masses. You don't have any clubbing, cyanosis, or peripheral edema. Your distal pulses are normal throughout both arms and both legs. Neurologically, your mentation, mood, and affect are normal, and you're oriented to person, place, and time. doctor: I've also reviewed your test results. Your EKG shows sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy, and your metabolic stress test indicates mild cardiopulmonary disease. Your laboratory data shows normal TSH, glucose, creatinine, potassium, and hematocrit. Your urinalysis was also normal. I've also reviewed your echocardiogram, which shows a dilated cardiomyopathy with an EF of 15% and a left ventricular diastolic dimension of 6.8 cm. There are no significant valvular abnormalities. Your stress thallium showed no scintigraphic evidence of stress-induced myocardial ischemia, but there is a fixed small-sized mild-to-moderate intensity perfusion defect in the distal inferior wall and apex, which may be an old infarct. doctor: Based on all of this information, it appears that you have a newly diagnosed dilated cardiomyopathy. The etiology of this is uncertain, but there is a strong genetic component. We'll need to do some family screening to make sure your siblings and children haven't developed the same condition. patient: What does this mean for me? doctor: Well, we'll need to start you on some medications to help manage your condition. I'm going to prescribe an ACE inhibitor, lisinopril, and a beta-blocker, carvedilol. We'll start with low doses and gradually increase them over the next few weeks. I'll also recommend that you start taking a loop diuretic, such as furosemide, to help reduce fluid retention. In addition, you should make some lifestyle changes, such as eating a healthy diet, getting regular exercise, and managing your stress. patient: I'll do whatever it takes to get better. doctor: I'm confident that we can help you manage your condition and improve your quality of life. I'll see you again in 3 to 6 months to check on your progress. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to call my office.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Heart failure symptoms.
