"doctor: Good morning, Mr. A. Thank you for coming in today. I understand you're here for a new patient evaluation. patient: That's right. doctor: Can you tell me a little bit about your medical history? patient: Well, I've had two surgeries in the past. The first was in July of 2006, and the second was in August of 2007. After that, I started having seizures and hemiparesis. I've been in and out of the hospital, and I developed C. diff. I'm currently in a nursing home because I'm unable to care for myself. doctor: I see. I've reviewed your medical records, including the information from the nursing home. It looks like you're taking Keppra, Decadron, oxycodone, aspirin, Prilosec, Dilantin, and Flagyl. Is that correct? patient: Yes, that's right. doctor: Okay. I've also reviewed your imaging studies. It shows that you have a malignant meningioma with progression of disease and significant brain edema. patient: What does that mean? doctor: It means that the tumor has grown and is causing swelling in your brain. This is causing your symptoms, such as the seizures, hemiparesis, and confusion. patient: So what can be done about it? doctor: Unfortunately, there are no good treatment options for malignant meningioma. Chemotherapy is an option, but you're not in a condition to receive it. Surgery is another option, but I don't think it would be in your best interest. The likelihood of benefit from surgery is small, and there's a good chance that you wouldn't be able to recover. patient: I don't understand. Why wouldn't surgery help? doctor: Because the tumor is so aggressive, it's likely to come back even after surgery. And the surgery itself is very risky. You could end up with more problems than you have now. patient: So what are my options? doctor: I'm afraid there aren't any good options. The best we can do is try to manage your symptoms and make you as comfortable as possible. patient: That's it? There's nothing else that can be done? doctor: I'm sorry, but that's the reality of the situation. patient: (Silence) doctor: I know this is a lot to take in. I'm here to answer any questions you have. patient: (Silence) doctor: I'm going to give you some information about malignant meningioma and the different treatment options. I'll also give you a referral to a palliative care specialist. They can help you manage your symptoms and provide support to you and your family. patient: Thank you. doctor: You're welcome. I'm here if you need anything else.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT New patient evaluation.

"doctor: Hello, I'm Dr. doctor's name. I understand you're here because your baby has been irritable and has had a fever for about 24 hours. Is that right? patient: Yes, that's right. He's been really fussy and crying a lot. He's also been vomiting a little bit. doctor: I see. And when did this all start? patient: It started about 48 hours ago. He was doing fine before that. doctor: Okay. And has he had any other symptoms, like diarrhea or a rash? patient: No, just the fever, fussiness, and vomiting. doctor: I see. Well, I'm going to examine him now and then we'll talk about what might be causing these symptoms. (The doctor examines the baby.) doctor: His vital signs are stable, but he is febrile at 101 degrees. His anterior fontanelle is not bulging. His neck is supple, with no nuchal rigidity. His heart rate is rapid, but there's no murmur. His lungs are clear. His abdomen is without mass, distention, or visceromegaly. His extremities are normal. He does have a skin pattern of cutis marmorata, which is a bit more exaggerated since he's febrile and has some peripheral vasodilatation. patient: What does that mean? doctor: Cutis marmorata is a harmless skin condition that causes a mottled, reddish-blue pattern on the skin. It's common in newborns and usually goes away on its own. patient: Okay. doctor: Well, based on my examination and your description of his symptoms, I think it's likely that he has a viral syndrome, such as viral meningitis or the flu. We'll need to do some tests to confirm the diagnosis, but in the meantime, we'll start him on supportive care, including IV fluids and Tylenol for his fever. We'll also continue the antibiotics until his spinal fluid cultures and blood cultures are negative for 48 hours. patient: Okay. doctor: I know this is a lot to take in, but I want to assure you that we're doing everything we can to help your baby. We'll keep you updated on his progress. patient: Thank you.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Fever, fussiness, and vomiting in a 2-day-old baby.

"doctor: Hello, Mr./Ms. patient, thank you for coming in today. I understand you're here for complaints of low back and right thigh pain. patient: That's right, doctor. It's been going on for a while now, and it's really starting to affect my daily life. doctor: I see. Can you tell me a little bit more about the pain? Where exactly do you feel it, and how would you describe it? patient: It's mostly in my lower back, between L4 and the sacrum. It's a sharp, stabbing pain that sometimes radiates down my right thigh. It's been especially bad lately, and I've been having trouble sleeping and working. doctor: I understand. Have you seen a doctor about this before? patient: Yes, I was seen in your clinic on 04/12/05. I was prescribed a Medrol Dosepak, and it helped reduce the pain a bit. But it's still there, and it's still interfering with my life. doctor: I see. Well, let's take a look at your back and see if we can find anything that might be causing the pain. The doctor performs a physical examination of the patient's back. doctor: Your range of motion is limited, and you're tender to palpation. There's no overt muscular spasm, and your reflexes are symmetric. patient: So what does that mean? doctor: Well, it means that there's something going on in your back that's causing the pain. It could be a herniated disc, or it could be something else. We'll need to do some more tests to figure it out. patient: What kind of tests? doctor: We'll start with an MRI. That will give us a detailed look at your spine and help us see what's causing the pain. patient: Okay. And what happens after that? doctor: Once we know what's causing the pain, we can start treating it. We may need to prescribe medication, or we may need to do surgery. But we'll take it one step at a time. patient: I'm glad to hear that. I'm ready to do whatever it takes to get rid of this pain. doctor: I'm glad to hear that. We'll work together to get you feeling better. The doctor and patient discuss the patient's medical history, including his previous back surgeries and his current medications. doctor: Okay, Mr./Ms. patient, I've reviewed your medical history and your test results. I've also examined your back. I believe that you have a herniated disc at L4-L5. This is a condition in which the soft, jelly-like center of an intervertebral disc pushes through the tough outer layer of the disc. This can cause pain, numbness, and weakness in the back and legs. patient: So what can we do about it? doctor: There are a few different treatment options for a herniated disc. We can start with conservative treatment, such as physical therapy and pain medication. If that doesn't help, we may need to consider surgery. patient: I'm not sure I want to have surgery. doctor: I understand. Surgery is always a last resort. But if conservative treatment doesn't help, it may be the best option for you. patient: I'll think about it. doctor: Okay. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a new pain medication. I'm also going to refer you to a physical therapist. patient: Thank you, doctor. doctor: You're welcome. I'm here to help.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Low back and right thigh pain.

"doctor: Good morning, patient. How are you doing today? patient: I'm doing okay. I'm here for a follow-up appointment after my recent hospitalization for iron deficiency anemia. doctor: I see. Can you tell me a little bit more about your symptoms? patient: Well, I was feeling really tired and weak.

"doctor: Hello Mrs./Ms. patient, thank you for coming in today. I understand you're here because of some back pain and right leg pain. Can you tell me a little bit more about that? patient: Sure. I've been having back pain and right leg pain for about two years now. It started after I was diagnosed with small cell lung cancer. The cancer has spread to my femurs, lower lumbar spine, and pelvis. doctor: I see. So, the pain started after your cancer diagnosis and has been ongoing since then? patient: Yes, that's right. I've had numerous chemotherapy and radiation treatments, but the pain hasn't gone away. I just finished a series of 10 radiation treatments for pain relief, but it didn't help much. doctor: I understand. Can you describe the pain in more detail? Where exactly do you feel it, and what does it feel like? patient: The pain is mostly in my low back on the right side. It radiates down the back of my right leg to my knee. I also have some numbness in the bottom of my left foot, and some sharp pain in the left foot at times. The pain is sharp, dull, and aching. It's a 10 out of 10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst possible pain. doctor: Okay, and what makes the pain worse or better? patient: It seems to be worse while sitting in the car for a long time, standing, or walking. doctor: I see. And what medications are you taking for the pain? patient: I'm on Duragesic patch 250 mcg total, Celebrex 200 mg once daily, iron 240 mg twice daily, Paxil 20 mg daily, and Percocet.

I'd like to do a physical exam now to get a better understanding of your condition. doctor: (performs physical exam) doctor: Based on my examination and your history, I think you have a symptomatic facet and sacroiliac joint syndrome on the right. This is likely causing your back pain and right leg pain. I'd like to inject your right sacroiliac and facet joints under fluoroscopy today. This is a minimally invasive procedure that can help relieve your pain. patient: Okay, I'm willing to try that. doctor: Great. I'll explain the procedure in more detail and get your consent. I'll also ask for a stat protime today since you're on warfarin. We generally don't perform injections while patients are on warfarin, but since you're on a very small dose and have had previous biopsies while on it without any complications, we should be okay. patient: That sounds good. doctor: I've also asked that you stop taking Paxil and start taking Cymbalta instead. Cymbalta is a medication that can help with both depression and pain. I've also asked for an x-ray of your lumbar spine for further evaluation. patient: Okay, I'll do all of that. doctor: Great.

"doctor: Good morning, Mr. patient, thank you for coming in today. I understand you've been experiencing some heart failure symptoms. Can you tell me more about what you've been feeling? patient: Well, I've been feeling generally okay, but I've been stressed and fatigued. I work hard running three companies, and I've noticed shortness of breath with exertion and occasional shortness of breath at rest. I've also had some PND, but I sleep on one pillow. I don't have any edema now, but I've had some mild leg swelling in the past. I've never had any angina, palpitations, syncope, or near syncope. When I take my pulse, I notice some irregularity. I don't follow any special diet and I don't get regular exercise, although I've recently started walking for half an hour a day. Over the past year, these symptoms have been slowly getting worse. I've also gained about 20 pounds. doctor: I see. Do you have any history of heart failure or other heart problems? patient: No, I don't. doctor: What about your past medical history? Any notable conditions or surgeries? patient: I had a right inguinal hernia repair in 1982 and trauma to my right thumb. I don't have a history of high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, or heart murmur. doctor: Okay. Now, let's talk about your social history. Where do you live, and who do you live with? patient: I live in San Salvador with my wife. I have a lot of stress in my life. I don't smoke, but I do drink. I have a high school education. doctor: And your family history? Any heart conditions or other significant illnesses? patient: My mother is alive at age 89. My father died at 72 of a heart attack. I have two brothers and one sister, all of whom are healthy, although my oldest brother suffered a myocardial infarction. I have three healthy girls and nine healthy grandchildren. doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. I'm going to perform a comprehensive cardiovascular examination now. The doctor performs the examination. doctor: Based on my examination, I've noted a few findings. Your blood pressure is 120/70 in each arm seated, your pulse is 80 beats per minute and regular, and your breathing is 12 times per minute and unlabored. Your heart rhythm is regular, and your first and second heart sounds are normal. However, you do have a fourth heart sound and a soft systolic murmur. Your precordial impulse is enlarged. Your lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion, and your abdomen is soft without hepatosplenomegaly or masses. You don't have any clubbing, cyanosis, or peripheral edema. Your distal pulses are normal throughout both arms and both legs. Neurologically, your mentation, mood, and affect are normal, and you're oriented to person, place, and time. doctor: I've also reviewed your test results. Your EKG shows sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy, and your metabolic stress test indicates mild cardiopulmonary disease. Your laboratory data shows normal TSH, glucose, creatinine, potassium, and hematocrit. Your urinalysis was also normal. I've also reviewed your echocardiogram, which shows a dilated cardiomyopathy with an EF of 15% and a left ventricular diastolic dimension of 6.8 cm. There are no significant valvular abnormalities. Your stress thallium showed no scintigraphic evidence of stress-induced myocardial ischemia, but there is a fixed small-sized mild-to-moderate intensity perfusion defect in the distal inferior wall and apex, which may be an old infarct. doctor: Based on all of this information, it appears that you have a newly diagnosed dilated cardiomyopathy. The etiology of this is uncertain, but there is a strong genetic component. We'll need to do some family screening to make sure your siblings and children haven't developed the same condition. patient: What does this mean for me? doctor: Well, we'll need to start you on some medications to help manage your condition. I'm going to prescribe an ACE inhibitor, lisinopril, and a beta-blocker, carvedilol. We'll start with low doses and gradually increase them over the next few weeks. I'll also recommend that you start taking a loop diuretic, such as furosemide, to help reduce fluid retention. In addition, you should make some lifestyle changes, such as eating a healthy diet, getting regular exercise, and managing your stress. patient: I'll do whatever it takes to get better. doctor: I'm confident that we can help you manage your condition and improve your quality of life.

"doctor: Good morning, Mr./Ms. Patient's name. I'm Dr. Doctor's name, and I'll be seeing you today. I understand you're here for a consultation regarding your neurogenic bladder and recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs). patient: That's right, doctor. doctor: Can you tell me a little bit about your current symptoms? patient: Well, I've been having intermittent self-catheterization three times a day, and I change my catheter weekly. Other than that, I'm not experiencing any dysuria, gross hematuria, fever, or chills. doctor: Okay. And when did your symptoms start? patient: I was seen in the ER on June 24th with fever, weakness, and possible urosepsis. I had a blood culture and urine culture done, and both came back positive for Staphylococcus epidermidis. I was treated with IV antibiotics and discharged home. I'm not taking any antibiotics now. doctor: I see. Do you have any history of kidney problems? patient: Yes, I had a renal transplant, which is being followed by Dr. X. I'm also on chronic steroids for that. doctor: Okay. And have you had any recent imaging studies done? patient: Yes, I had a renal ultrasound on June 23rd. It showed mild hydronephrosis of the renal transplant with fluid in the pericapsular space. doctor: I see. And what were your creatinine and BUN levels on July 7th? patient: My creatinine was 2.0 and my BUN was 36. Dr. X is following those levels. doctor: Okay. Well, based on your history and symptoms, I'm going to diagnose you with neurogenic bladder and recurrent UTI. The steroids you're taking for your renal transplant are likely suppressing your immune system and making you more susceptible to infections. patient: I see. So what do we do now? doctor: Well, we're going to continue with intermittent self-catheterization, and we'll change your catheter weekly. We'll also discuss the technique of catheterization again to make sure you're doing it correctly. patient: Okay. doctor: In addition, I'm going to prescribe Keflex nighttime prophylaxis for the next three months. This should help to prevent future UTIs. patient: Okay. doctor: I'd like you to follow up with me in September so we can reassess your condition. patient: Okay. doctor: In the meantime, if you have any concerns, please don't hesitate to call my office. patient: Thank you, doctor. doctor: You're welcome.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Consultation regarding neurogenic bladder and recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs).

"doctor: Good morning, Mrs. patient. I'm Dr. doctor, and I'll be your physician today. I understand you've been experiencing chest pain. Can you tell me more about that? patient: Well, I had some chest pain a while back, but it's gone away now. I'm not sure why I was sent to the hospital. doctor: I see. Well, the tests we've run show that you have severe aortic stenosis. That means the valve in your heart that controls blood flow to your body is narrowed. This can cause chest pain, shortness of breath, and fatigue. patient: Oh, I didn't know that. doctor: I understand that you're hesitant about having surgery, but it's important to weigh the risks and benefits. Without surgery, your aortic stenosis could get worse and lead to serious complications, including heart failure. patient: I know, but I'm afraid of surgery. I've had a lot of bad experiences with doctors in the past. doctor: I understand your concerns. I want to assure you that we'll do everything we can to make sure you're comfortable and safe. We'll also work with your psychiatrist to make sure your mental health is taken care of. patient: That would be helpful. doctor: I'm also concerned about your history of substance abuse.

"doctor: Good morning, patient. Thank you for coming in today. I understand you're here for a second opinion on your kyphosis. patient: That's right. I've been noticing a round back posture for a while now, and my parents took me to another orthopedist who recommended observation. I wanted to get a second opinion to see if there are any other treatment options. doctor: I see. Well, let's start with a few questions. Are you experiencing any pain in your back or any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your upper or lower extremities? patient: No, I don't have any pain or numbness. doctor: Okay. And have you had any problems with your bowels or bladder? patient: No, everything's been normal. doctor: That's good to hear. Now, I'm going to do a physical exam to get a better understanding of your condition. The doctor performs a physical exam, checking the patient's skin, muscles, and range of motion. doctor: Based on my exam, it appears that you have a mild kyphosis.

Your X-rays also showed a 46-degree kyphosis. patient: So, what does this mean? doctor: Well, kyphosis is a condition where the spine curves abnormally forward. In your case, the curve is mild and is likely within the normal range for an adolescent. However, we'll need to monitor it closely to make sure it doesn't progress. patient: What are my treatment options? doctor: There are three main options: observation, physical therapy, and bracing. Since your kyphosis is mild and you're still growing, we can start with observation and physical therapy. The physical therapy will focus on extension-based strengthening exercises, flexibility range of motion exercises, and postural training. We'll see you back in 3 months for repeat radiographs to assess your progress. If the kyphosis shows signs of progression, we may need to consider bracing. patient: Okay, I understand. doctor: I'm also going to give you a prescription for Ceftin to treat your ear infection. patient: Thank you. doctor: You're welcome.

Cataract surgery removes the cloudy lens and replaces it with a clear artificial lens. This can often restore vision to near-normal levels. patient: That's encouraging. But what about my macular degeneration? doctor: Macular degeneration is a serious condition that can lead to vision loss. However, cataract surgery can actually help to slow the progression of macular degeneration. By removing the cataracts, we can improve the clarity of the images that reach the macula. This can help to preserve vision and prevent further damage. patient: That's good to know. I think I'm starting to feel a little better about cataract surgery. doctor: I'm glad to hear that. I know it's a big decision, but I'm confident that cataract surgery is the right choice for you. patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help. doctor: You're welcome.

"Doctor: Hello, Mrs. Patient, thank you for coming in today. I understand you're here for an evaluation of angina. Patient: That's right, doctor. I've been having this chest pain for the past few hours, and it's been getting worse. Doctor: I see. Can you describe the pain for me? Patient: It's a crushing pain in my chest. It started suddenly while I was exercising, and it's been radiating to my arm and jaw. I've also been feeling nauseous. Doctor: Okay, and how severe would you say the pain is? Patient: It's pretty severe. It's not getting any better, and it's starting to interfere with my daily activities. Doctor: I see. Do you have any known medical allergies? Patient: No, I don't.

Patient: No, I don't. Doctor: Have you had any previous surgeries? Patient: No, I haven't. Doctor: Do you smoke or use tobacco products? Patient: Yes, I do. I've been smoking a pack a day for about 40 years. Doctor: Okay. Do you have any family history of heart disease? Patient: Yes, my father had a heart attack when he was in his 60s. Doctor: I see. Well, Mrs. Patient, based on your symptoms and medical history, I think it's likely that you're experiencing angina pectoris. This is a condition in which the blood flow to your heart is reduced, causing chest pain. Patient: What causes angina pectoris? Doctor: There are a number of things that can cause angina pectoris, including coronary artery disease, which is a narrowing of the arteries that supply blood to your heart. Smoking, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure are all risk factors for coronary artery disease. Patient: So, what can I do to treat my angina? Doctor: There are a number of things we can do. First, we need to get your risk factors under control. This means quitting smoking, lowering your cholesterol, and managing your blood pressure. We may also prescribe medication to help improve blood flow to your heart and reduce chest pain. Patient: Okay, I'll do whatever it takes to get better. Doctor: I'm glad to hear that. I'm going to order some tests to confirm the diagnosis and to rule out other potential causes of your chest pain. I'm also going to start you on a medication to help relieve your symptoms.

"doctor: Good afternoon, Mr. ABC. I'm Dr. doctor, and I'll be your cardiologist today. I understand you've been experiencing some chest pain. patient: Yes, that's right. I've been having chest pain for the past few weeks. It started out as a mild pain, but it's gotten worse over time. Now, it's severe and it comes on after just a few minutes of exercise. doctor: I see. And have you been experiencing any other symptoms, such as shortness of breath or lightheadedness? patient: No, not really. Just the chest pain. doctor: Okay. Well, I'd like to run a few tests to try to figure out what's causing your chest pain. We'll start with a stress test. patient: Sure. doctor: (After the stress test) Well, Mr. ABC, the stress test showed that you have severe chest pain after just 5 minutes of exercise. We also saw some horizontal ST depressions and moderate apical ischemia on the stress imaging. patient: What does that mean? doctor: It means that there's a blockage in your arteries that's preventing blood from flowing properly to your heart. This can cause chest pain and other symptoms. patient: Is it serious? doctor: It can be. If the blockage is severe, it can lead to a heart attack. That's why I'm recommending that we do a cardiac catheterization. patient: What's that? doctor: It's a procedure where we insert a thin tube into your artery and inject a dye that will help us see the blockage. patient: Okay. doctor: (After the cardiac catheterization) Well, Mr. ABC, the cardiac catheterization showed that you have mild-to-moderate left main distal disease, moderate proximal LAD with a severe mid-LAD lesion, and a mid-left circumflex lesion. patient: What does that mean? doctor: It means that you have a blockage in several of your arteries. The blockage in your left anterior descending artery is the most severe. This is the artery that supplies blood to the front of your heart. patient: So, what do we do now? doctor: I'm recommending that we transfer you to Medical Center for PCI. PCI is a procedure where we insert a stent into the artery to open up the blockage. patient: Okay. I'm agreeable with that. doctor: I've already spoken with Dr. X at Medical Center, and he has kindly accepted you in transfer.

I'm concerned about the worsening of your gait, dementia, and incontinence. I've also noticed a new finding today, which is limited upgaze. This could be consistent with either progressive supranuclear palsy or progressive enlargement of the ventricles. patient: (Wife and daughter look at each other with concern) What does that mean? doctor: Well, it means that we need to consider all the possible causes of your symptoms and determine the best course of treatment. One option is to try a trial of CSF drainage via spinal catheter again. This is a procedure where we insert a thin tube into your spinal canal to drain excess cerebrospinal fluid. We did this over a year ago at Hospital, but it didn't seem to help at the time. However, your ventricles appear to be larger now than they were a year ago, so it's possible that hydrocephalus is still contributing to your symptoms. wife: (Hesitantly) So, you're saying that there's a chance that surgery could help? doctor: Yes, that's right. But it's important to understand that there is no guarantee. The success of shunt surgery depends on many factors, including the underlying cause of your symptoms. daughter: (With a sigh) I guess we have a lot to think about. doctor: I understand.

"doctor: Good morning, Mr. patient, how are you doing today? patient: I'm doing alright, Doctor. I'm here for a follow-up on my recent TIA-like event. doctor: I see. Can you tell me more about what happened? patient: Well, about three weeks ago, I was driving my car when suddenly my vision started to decrease. It was like a black sheet was coming down from the top. It lasted for about five minutes, and I felt nauseated and lightheaded during the episode. doctor: Did you experience any other symptoms, such as headaches, gait change, or focal weakness? patient: No, nothing like that. Just the vision loss. doctor: I understand. And what happened after the episode? patient: I went to the clinic that day and had a CT scan, carotid Dopplers, an echocardiogram, and a neurological evaluation. But everything came back normal. doctor: That's good to hear. The neurologist suggested a CT angiogram since I can't have an MRI due to my pacemaker. But I haven't had any further similar events since then. doctor: That's a relief. Now, let's talk about your lumbar stenosis. You mentioned that you have mild difficulty getting out of a chair. Have you experienced any back pain or pain of any type? patient: No, I don't have any pain. I'm very active, and I play tennis at least three times a week. I've also never had any bowel or bladder incontinence or frank lower extremity weakness. doctor: I see. Well, based on your symptoms, it seems like your lumbar stenosis is mild. Since you're not interested in surgical intervention at this time, we'll defer further evaluation with a CT myelogram. patient: That's good news. I'd rather not have surgery if I don't need it. doctor: Alright, let's move on to your medications. You're currently taking Plavix and Synthroid, is that correct? patient: Yes, that's right. doctor: Okay. I'm going to continue your Plavix prescription. We'll also get a CT angiogram of your cerebral vessels to evaluate the integrity of your cerebrovascular system. patient: Okay, I'll do that. doctor: Great. And finally, we'll obtain copies of the workup that was done at the outside hospital so that we don't have to repeat any unnecessary tests. patient: Sure, I'll make sure to bring those with me on my next visit. doctor: That's all for today, Mr. patient. We'll follow up on your progress at your next appointment. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms, please don't hesitate to call our office. patient: Thank you, Doctor.

"doctor: Good morning, Mr./Ms. patient. How are you doing today? patient: I'm not doing so well, doctor. I've been having some abdominal pain. doctor: I see. Can you tell me more about the pain? Where is it located? patient: It's mostly in my lower abdomen, but it sometimes radiates to my back. doctor: How long have you been having the pain? patient: For about a week now. doctor: Have you noticed anything else unusual, such as changes in your bowel movements or urination? patient: Yes, I've been having more frequent urination and it burns when I go. doctor: I see. Well, I'm going to examine you now to try to figure out what's causing your pain. doctor: (Examines the patient's abdomen) Your abdomen is soft and nontender. There is no organomegaly or CVA tenderness. No hernias are noted. doctor: (Checks the patient's vital signs) Your blood pressure is 120/80 mmHg, your pulse is 80 bpm, and your respirations are 12 pm. You are afebrile. doctor: Based on your symptoms and examination, I think you have a urinary tract infection (UTI). patient: A UTI? What is that? doctor: A UTI is an infection of the urinary tract, which includes the bladder, urethra, and kidneys. It is usually caused by bacteria that enter the urethra and travel up into the bladder. patient: How do I get a UTI? doctor: UTIs are more common in women than in men, but they can occur in anyone. There are a number of things that can increase your risk of getting a UTI, such as having diabetes, being sexually active, or using a catheter. patient: I have diabetes. Could that be why I got a UTI? doctor: Yes, diabetes can increase your risk of getting a UTI. That's because high blood sugar levels can damage the nerves that control the bladder, making it more difficult to empty the bladder completely. This can lead to bacteria building up in the bladder and causing an infection. doctor: I'm going to prescribe you some antibiotics to treat the UTI. I also want you to see an endocrinologist to help you manage your diabetes. patient: Okay, I will. Thank you, doctor. doctor: You're welcome.

"doctor: Hello, Mrs. patient, I'm Dr. doctor. I understand you're here today because you've been experiencing some weakness on your right side. patient: Yes, that's right. I woke up this morning and my right arm was weak and I was having trouble speaking. doctor: I see. Can you tell me a little bit more about your symptoms? patient: Well, my right arm is definitely weak. I can't lift it up very high and I have trouble gripping things. I'm also having trouble speaking. I can understand what people are saying, but I have trouble getting the words out. doctor: Okay. Have you had any other symptoms, like headache, visual changes, chest pain, or shortness of breath? patient: No, nothing like that. doctor: And have your symptoms been getting better or worse since they started? patient: They've stayed about the same. doctor: I see. Do you have any idea what might have caused this? patient: I'm not sure. I've been feeling fine until this morning. doctor: Okay. Well, I'm going to do a few tests to try to figure out what's going on. I'm going to order a head CT and an MRI to look at your brain. I'm also going to order some blood tests and an ultrasound of your carotids. patient: Okay. doctor: I'm also going to start you on some medications to help with your symptoms.

We need to wait for the test results to come back. But based on her symptoms, I'm concerned that she may have had a stroke or a transient ischemic attack (TIA). daughter: What's the difference between a stroke and a TIA? doctor: A stroke is a sudden loss of blood flow to the brain. A TIA is a temporary loss of blood flow to the brain. The symptoms of a TIA are usually the same as the symptoms of a stroke, but they go away within 24 hours. daughter: I see. So, what are the chances that my mother had a stroke? doctor: It's hard to say for sure until we get the test results back. But based on her symptoms, I would say that the chances are fairly high. daughter: What are the chances that she'll have another stroke? doctor: That also depends on the test results. But if she did have a stroke, the chances of her having another one are higher than the chances of someone who has never had a stroke. daughter: I see. Thank you for your time. doctor: You're welcome. I'll be back to check on your mother later.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Right-sided weakness.

I understand you're here for management of hepatic encephalopathy? patient: Yes, that's right. doctor: Can you tell me a little bit about what's been going on? patient: Well, I was doing fine until I fell in the bathroom last night. I was just sitting watching TV and I felt sleepy, so I went to the bathroom to urinate before going to bed. While I was trying to lift the seat, I tripped and fell and hit my head on the toilet seat. It started bleeding and I had pain in the area with a headache. I didn't lose consciousness, though. I went and woke up my sister, and she brought a towel to cover the laceration on the back of my head and called EMS. They came to my house and brought me to the emergency room. doctor: I see. And what happened after you got to the emergency room? patient: They found that I had a laceration on the back of my head, which they stapled. They also did a CT of my head and ruled out any acute intracranial pathology. But my ammonia levels were found to be markedly elevated at 106, so I'm being admitted for management of that. doctor: Okay, I understand. Have you been having any other symptoms besides the fall and the head injury? patient: No, I haven't had any abdominal pain, change in bowel habits, GI bleed, hematemesis, melena, or hematochezia. I've been taking my medications, but I can't remember what they are. I also don't remember having any symptoms prior to the fall. doctor: I see. Well, I'm going to examine you now and then we can discuss your treatment plan. The doctor performs a physical examination. doctor: Your examination is essentially unremarkable except for a laceration on the back of your head with two staples, which is still oozing minimally and is tender. You also have +1 edema bilaterally and several spider angiomas noted on your torso and upper extremities consistent with liver cirrhosis. Your right-sided spastic hemiparesis with increased tone, increased reflexes, and weakness is consistent with your history of subdural hematoma. patient: Okay. doctor: So, based on your history and examination, I'm going to admit you to the hospital for management of your hepatic encephalopathy. We'll start you on lactulose and monitor your ammonia levels closely. We'll also need to address your other medical conditions, such as your liver cirrhosis and diabetes. patient: Okay, I understand. doctor: I'll also order a few tests to get a better understanding of your condition, such as a liver function panel, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. patient: Sure. doctor: I'll be back later to check on you and answer any questions you may have. patient: Thank you, doctor.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Management of hepatic encephalopathy.

"patient: Doctor, I've been having some problems with my left leg swelling. It's been going on for about three years now, but it's gotten worse in the past few months.

Well, let's take a look at your leg and do a physical exam. doctor: (Examines the patient's leg) Your left leg is definitely swollen. There's at least 2+ pedal edema. Your right leg has just a trace of edema. I'm also going to order a venous Doppler of your left leg and a CBC and metabolic panel. I'm going to start you on Detrol 0.4 mg once daily and Mobic 15 mg per day. patient: Okay. What else can I do to help with the swelling? doctor: Elevate your leg as much as possible and wear support hose if you can. Keep your foot up during the day. We'll see you back in two weeks to review the results of the Doppler and lab work and see how you're doing with the Detrol and the joint pain.

"doctor: Welcome back to the Pulmonary Medicine Clinic, Mrs. Smith. I understand you're here for a follow-up evaluation of your interstitial disease secondary to lupus pneumonitis. patient: That's right, Doctor. doctor: How have you been doing since your last visit in January 2004? patient: My respiratory status has been pretty good overall. I haven't had any major respiratory difficulties. But starting yesterday, I've had increasing back and joint pain. Taking a deep breath causes some discomfort in my back. doctor: I see. And have you had any problems with coughing or producing sputum? patient: No, I haven't had any problems with that. I also haven't had any fevers or chills. doctor: Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your fatigue levels recently? patient: Yes, I've been feeling a bit more fatigued lately. doctor: That's something we'll need to look into. Aside from the back pain and fatigue, have you had any other pulmonary limitations to your activity? patient: No, for the most part, I've been able to do my usual activities without any problems. doctor: That's good to hear. Now, let's talk about your current medications. You mentioned that you were taking Synthroid, Prilosec, prednisone, Plaquenil, Imuran, Advair, Premarin, Lipitor, Actonel, and aspirin. Is that correct? patient: Yes, that's right. doctor: I see that you stopped taking prednisone on June 16th. Why was that? patient: My doctor told me I could stop taking it since my lupus has been under control. doctor: Okay. We'll need to keep an eye on that. You also mentioned that you're allergic to penicillin and shellfish. Is there anything else I should know about your allergies? patient: No, that's all. doctor: Alright. Let's move on to the physical exam. Your vital signs are all within normal limits. Your nasal mucosa is mildly erythematous and edematous, but your oropharynx is clear. Your neck is supple without any palpable lymphadenopathy. Your chest demonstrates decreased breath sounds, but it's clear. Your cardiovascular system is regular in rate and rhythm. Your abdomen is soft and nontender. Your extremities are without edema and there are no skin lesions. Your oxygen saturation was checked at rest and it was 96%. On ambulation, it varied between 94% and 96%. doctor: I've also reviewed your chest x-ray from today. It shows mild increased interstitial markings consistent with a history of lupus pneumonitis. Unfortunately, we don't have a previous chest x-ray to compare it to. However, when I compared the markings to your previous CT scan, they appear to be less prominent. patient: That's good news. doctor: It is. Now, let's talk about the next steps. Based on your current symptoms and the results of your physical exam and chest x-ray, I'm going to recommend that we continue with your current medications. I'd like to see you back in about four to five months for a follow-up visit. At that time, we'll recheck your pulmonary function test and do another chest CT scan. If your pulmonary status is stable and your lupus is under control, we may consider weaning you off of Imuran. patient: Okay. I'll make sure to come back for my follow-up visit. doctor: Great. In the meantime, if you have any new symptoms or if your condition worsens, please don't hesitate to call our office. patient: Thank you, Doctor.

"doctor: Hello, Mr. patient, I'm Dr. doctor. I understand you're here today because you're concerned about your cholesterol levels. patient: Yes, that's right. I got a letter from my doctor saying that my cholesterol is elevated. I'm a little worried about it. doctor: I can understand your concern. High cholesterol can increase your risk for heart disease and stroke. But the good news is that there are things you can do to lower your cholesterol levels. patient: That's good to hear. What can I do? doctor: Well, let's start by talking about your diet. Can you tell me what you typically eat in a day? patient: Sure. I usually start my day with a cappuccino and a croissant. For lunch, I often eat out, and I usually get something like a quiche or a sandwich. And for dinner, I usually have meat with potatoes and vegetables. I also snack on candy from the vending machines at work. doctor: I see. Well, there are a few things you can change in your diet to help lower your cholesterol. First, you should try to limit your intake of saturated and trans fats. These fats are found in foods like red meat, processed meats, and fried foods. You should also try to eat more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. These foods are high in fiber, which can help lower cholesterol levels. patient: Okay, I can do that. What else can I do? doctor: Another thing you can do is to exercise regularly. Exercise can help to lower cholesterol levels and improve your overall heart health. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week. patient: I'm already exercising six to seven days a week. I swim, bike, run, and lift weights. doctor: That's great! Keep up the good work. patient: I'm also trying to lose weight. I've already lost a few pounds by eating healthier and exercising more. doctor: That's excellent progress. Keep up the good work!

"doctor: Good morning, Mr. patient, I understand you're here today for left knee pain. Can you tell me more about what's been going on? patient: Sure, doctor.

"doctor: Hello, Mr. patient, I understand you're here today because you experienced a brief episode of visual loss three weeks ago. Can you tell me more about what happened? patient: Sure, doctor. I was driving my car when my vision started to decrease. It felt like a black sheet was coming down from the top, compressing my vision. The episode lasted about five minutes, and I was able to pull over to the side of the road safely. I felt nauseated and lightheaded during the episode, and my wife said I looked very pale and ashen. doctor: That sounds concerning. Did you seek medical attention at the time? patient: Yes, I went to the clinic and had a CT scan, carotid Dopplers, an echocardiogram, and a neurological evaluation. Everything came back normal. The doctor suggested I get a CT angiogram since I can't have an MRI due to my pacemaker. doctor: I see. Have you had any similar episodes since then? patient: No, I haven't.

"doctor: Good morning, Mr. Smith. How are you feeling today? patient: (nonverbal, confused look on face) doctor: I understand you've been experiencing some abdominal pain. Can you tell me a little bit more about it? patient: (unable to provide further history) doctor (to the patient's son): Can you tell me anything about your father's symptoms? son: He started having severe pain in his abdomen yesterday.

There are no associated paresthesias. doctor: I see. Have you seen any other doctors about this? patient: Yes, I've been seeing a chiropractor. doctor: What kind of treatment have you received from the chiropractor? patient: He's been doing adjustments and massages. doctor: Have they helped? patient: A little bit, but the pain always comes back. doctor: I understand. Well, I'm going to examine you today and see if I can find anything that's causing your pain. The doctor performs a physical examination. doctor: Your range of motion in your neck and back is limited, and I can feel some tenderness in your muscles. I'm also going to order some X-rays to get a better look at your spine. patient: Okay. doctor: I think we should also consider some physical therapy. That can help to strengthen your muscles and improve your range of motion. patient: I'm willing to try anything. doctor: I'm glad to hear that. I'm going to prescribe some pain medication to help you manage your pain in the meantime. patient: Thank you. doctor: You're welcome.

"doctor: Hello, patient. Thank you for coming in today. I understand you're here for a dietary consultation for diabetes during your pregnancy. patient: Yes, that's right. I had gestational diabetes with my first pregnancy and had to use insulin. I'm not entirely sure what ketones are. doctor: I see. Well, ketones are produced when your body doesn't have enough insulin or enough calories. When this happens, your body starts to break down fat for energy, which produces ketones. This can lead to a condition called ketoacidosis, which can be dangerous. patient: That sounds serious. doctor: It can be, but we'll do everything we can to prevent that from happening. I've reviewed your blood sugar records for the last week, and your overall average is 140. We'll need to work on getting that number down. patient: Okay. What do I need to do? doctor: First, we need to adjust your insulin doses. I'm going to increase your morning dose from 20 units to 24 units and your evening dose from 13 units to 16 units. We'll also need to make some changes to your diet. patient: What kind of changes? doctor: We'll need to reduce your intake of refined carbohydrates, such as white bread, pasta, and rice. We'll also need to increase your intake of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. I've created a 2300-calorie meal plan for you that includes a carbohydrate budget of 45%. This means that about 45% of your daily calories should come from carbohydrates. patient: That sounds doable. doctor: I'm also going to ask you to start checking your blood sugar more frequently. I'd like you to call me at the end of the week if your fasting blood sugar is over 90 or your two-hour postprandial blood sugar is over 120. patient: I will. doctor: Good.

I didn't feel any masses when I palpated his abdomen. His rectal exam was deferred, but there were no perianal lesions. doctor: Based on patient's symptoms and my examination, I think there are a few possible causes for the bleeding. One possibility is a Meckel's diverticulum, which is a small pouch that can form in the small intestine. Another possibility is a polyp, which is a small growth that can grow in the colon or rectum. We also need to consider an infection or a vascular malformation. doctor: To help us figure out what's causing the bleeding, I'd like to order a Meckel scan today.

"doctor: Hello, patient, I'm doctor, the surgeon who will be evaluating you today. I understand you've been referred to me for a thyroid mass that was recently diagnosed as papillary carcinoma. Can you tell me a little bit more about your symptoms? patient: Sure. I first noticed a small lump in my thyroid about a year ago. It didn't bother me at first, but it started to get bigger recently. I went to the Pediatric Endocrinology Department, and they did a fine needle aspiration biopsy, which confirmed it was papillary thyroid carcinoma. doctor: I see. Have you experienced any other symptoms, such as hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, or weight changes? patient: No, I haven't had any of those symptoms. My weight has been stable, and I don't have any trouble swallowing or speaking. doctor: That's good to hear. Do you have any family history of thyroid cancer or other endocrine disorders? patient: Not that I know of. My father mentioned that his mother had thyroid surgery, but he's not sure if it was for cancer or goiter. doctor: Okay. I'll make a note of that. Now, let's take a closer look at your neck. (The doctor performs a physical examination of the patient's neck.) doctor: I can feel a slightly visible midline bulge in the region of the thyroid isthmus. There's also a firm nodule there, and some nodularity in the right lobe of the thyroid. The mass is relatively hard and slightly fixed, but it doesn't seem to be tethered to the surrounding tissues, skin, or muscles. I also noticed some shotty adenopathy in the area, but no supraclavicular nodes. patient: Does that mean the cancer has spread? doctor: It's possible, but we can't be sure until we do some further testing. I'd like to order a chest x-ray and review your laboratory data from the Diagnostics Lab. patient: Okay. (The doctor orders the tests and reviews the patient's medical history.) doctor: I see that you have a mild abnormality in your AST levels, but your T4, TSH, and free thyroxine levels are all normal. Your serum pregnancy test is also negative. Unfortunately, there's no level of thyroglobulin recorded on this. patient: What does all that mean? doctor: Well, the AST abnormality is not a major concern, but it's something we'll want to keep an eye on. The normal T4, TSH, and free thyroxine levels indicate that your thyroid is still functioning properly. The negative pregnancy test is important because we can't use radioactive iodine therapy if you're pregnant. And the thyroglobulin level is a marker for thyroid cancer, so we'll need to get that checked as soon as possible. patient: I see. doctor: Now, let's talk about the chest x-ray. The radiologist noted a diffuse pattern of tiny nodules in both lungs, which is typical of miliary metastatic disease that is often seen in patients with metastatic thyroid carcinoma. This is unfortunate because it generally means a more advanced stage of disease. patient: (Visibly upset) Oh no. Does that mean the cancer has spread to my lungs? doctor: It's possible, but we can't be sure until we do a biopsy. I'll need to discuss this with the oncology team and see what they recommend. (The doctor spends the next 30 minutes discussing the surgical aspects of the treatment with the patient and her family.) doctor: I recommend performing a total thyroidectomy to remove the primary source of the cancer and eradicate as much of the native thyroid tissue as possible. We'll also do a sentinel node dissection to check for the spread of cancer to the lymph nodes. patient: What are the risks of surgery? doctor: There are a few potential risks, including damage to the recurrent laryngeal and external laryngeal branches of the nerve supplying the vocal cord function, which could lead to hoarseness or difficulty speaking. There's also a risk of hypoparathyroidism if all four of the parathyroid glands are damaged during the operation, which could lead to low calcium levels and other complications. patient: That's a lot to take in. doctor: I understand. This is a lot to process, and I'm here to answer any questions you have. (The doctor and the patient's family continue to discuss the surgery and the potential risks and benefits.) doctor: I've made every effort to get you scheduled for surgery within the next 48 hours. We're tentatively planning on proceeding this upcoming Friday afternoon with total thyroidectomy. In the meantime, I'll order the necessary tests and consult with the oncology team to discuss the best course of treatment. patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help. doctor: You're welcome. I'll see you again before the surgery to answer any additional questions you may have.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Thyroid mass evaluation. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a pleasant age-year-old female who presents for evaluation of a thyroid mass. She first noticed a small lump in her thyroid about a year ago. It didn't bother her at first, but it started to get bigger recently. She went to the Pediatric Endocrinology Department, and they did a fine needle aspiration biopsy, which confirmed it was papillary thyroid carcinoma. She denies hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, or weight changes. She has a mild abnormality in her AST levels, but her T4, TSH, and free thyroxine levels are all normal. Her serum pregnancy test is also negative. The chest x-ray showed a diffuse pattern of tiny nodules in both lungs, which is typical of miliary metastatic disease that is often seen in patients with metastatic thyroid carcinoma. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. Papillary thyroid carcinoma Assessment: Fine needle aspiration biopsy of the thyroid mass confirmed papillary thyroid carcinoma. Physical examination revealed a slightly visible midline bulge in the region of the thyroid isthmus, a firm nodule there, and some nodularity in the right lobe of the thyroid. There is also some shotty adenopathy in the area. Chest x-ray showed a diffuse pattern of tiny nodules in both lungs, which is typical of miliary metastatic disease. Plan: - Will schedule a total thyroidectomy and sentinel node dissection within the next 48 hours. - Will consult with the oncology team to discuss the best course of treatment. - Will obtain thyroglobulin level. 2. AST abnormality Assessment: Mild abnormality in AST levels. Plan: - Will monitor AST levels. 3. Metastatic thyroid carcinoma Assessment: Diffuse pattern of tiny nodules in both lungs on chest x-ray, suggestive of metastatic thyroid carcinoma. Plan: - Will discuss with oncology team regarding further evaluation and management. 4. Risk of hypocalcemia Assessment: Potential risk of hypoparathyroidism if all four of the parathyroid glands are damaged during the operation. Plan: - Will monitor calcium levels postoperatively. 5. Risk of vocal cord dysfunction Assessment: Potential risk of damage to the recurrent laryngeal and external laryngeal branches of the nerve supplying the vocal cord function during surgery. Plan: - Will monitor vocal cord function postoperatively. Follow-up instructions: - The patient will be seen again before the surgery to answer any additional questions. - The patient will follow up with the oncology team after surgery to discuss further treatment options.",4663,2557,"['thyroid carcinoma unfortunate', 'experienced symptoms hoarseness', 'biopsy confirmed papillary', 'mass recently diagnosed', 'swallowing weight changes']"

"doctor: Good morning, Mr. patient, I'm Dr. doctor. I understand you're here for evaluation of your pneumothorax and subcutaneous emphysema. Can you tell me a little bit about what's been going on? patient: Sure. It all started on Monday when I had this sharp pain in my shoulder blade. I went to the emergency room, and they did a CT scan that showed I had a small pneumothorax and a lot of subcutaneous emphysema. They admitted me for observation. doctor: I see. And how have you been feeling since then? patient: The pain in my shoulder blade has gotten better, but my voice has been hoarse, and I still have some shortness of breath. doctor: Okay. I'm going to examine you now. The doctor performs a physical exam. doctor: Your lungs sound clear, and your heart rate and rhythm are regular. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. And your skin shows significant subcutaneous emphysema in the upper chest and anterior neck area, although you say it's improved since yesterday. patient: Yes, it's definitely gotten better. doctor: That's good to hear. I've reviewed your CT scan results, and I agree with the radiologist's impression that you have a small pneumothorax and subcutaneous emphysema. The most likely cause is either a parenchymal lung tear or a small tracheobronchial tree rend. patient: What does that mean? doctor: It means that there's a tear in the lining of your lung or in the small airways. This can happen from trauma, like a fall or a car accident. patient: I haven't had any accidents recently. doctor: It's possible that the tear happened spontaneously. This is more common in people who have certain lung conditions, like emphysema or asthma. Do you have any history of lung problems? patient: No, I don't. doctor: Okay. Well, we're going to consult with the CT Surgery and Pulmonary services to get their recommendations. In the meantime, we'll continue to monitor you and treat your symptoms. patient: Okay.

"doctor: Hello, patient. Thank you for coming in today. I understand you've been experiencing some unusual spells recently. Can you tell me more about what's been happening? patient (father): Sure. Patient's name has been having these brief periods where she pauses and stares. She becomes unresponsive, but she doesn't lose her balance or fall. doctor: How long do these spells typically last? patient (mother): They vary. I've seen them last anywhere from 10 to 15 seconds, but patient's father says they can last up to 3 or 4 minutes. doctor: I see. Have you noticed anything else unusual during these spells, like any changes in her breathing or skin color? patient (mother): Yes, actually. During one of the spells outside a store recently, her lips turned blue for a few seconds. But she's never had any convulsions or shaking. doctor: That's important information. Now, I'd like to ask you a few questions about patient's name's medical history. She has a history of febrile seizures, correct? patient (father): Yes, that's right. She's been taking Keppra to prevent them, and it's been working well. doctor: I see. Has there been any change in her Keppra dosage recently? patient (mother): No, she's still taking the same dose, 150 mg twice a day. doctor: Okay. I'd like to perform a physical examination to gather more information. If that's alright with you. patient (parents): Sure, go ahead. doctor: (Conducts physical examination) doctor: Based on your symptoms and examination findings, I believe patient's name may be experiencing partial complex seizures or possibly nonconvulsive generalized seizures. We'll need to do an EEG to confirm the diagnosis. patient (father): What's an EEG? doctor: An EEG is a test that records the electrical activity in the brain. It can help us identify any abnormal patterns that may be causing the seizures. patient (mother): Will patient's name need to be sedated for the EEG? doctor: It depends. If she tolerates the procedure well, we may not need to sedate her. However, if she becomes agitated or uncomfortable, we may need to give her a mild sedative to help her relax. patient (father): Okay. What are the next steps? doctor: First, we'll try to capture an EEG as long as patient's name tolerates it. If sedation is needed, we'll defer the EEG until we adjust her seizure medications and see how she responds. I'm also increasing her Keppra dosage to 300 mg twice a day, bringing her total daily dose to just under 40 mg/kg per day.

Can you tell me a little bit about your knee pain? patient: It's been going on for a couple of years now. It started as a clicking noise and stiffness, but it's gotten worse over time.

Have you tried any treatments for your knee pain? patient: I've tried physical therapy and pain medication, but nothing has helped. doctor: I see. Well, I think you're a good candidate for a total knee replacement. This is a surgery where we replace the damaged parts of your knee with artificial components. patient: What does that involve? doctor: Well, we'll make an incision in your knee and remove the damaged cartilage and bone. Then, we'll insert the artificial components. The surgery usually takes about two hours, and you'll stay in the hospital for a few days afterwards. patient: How long will it take me to recover? doctor: It takes most people about six to eight weeks to recover from a total knee replacement.

"doctor: Good morning, patient. I'm Dr. doctor, and I'll be your physician today. I understand you've been experiencing some health issues lately. Can you tell me a little bit about what's been going on? patient: Sure, doctor. It all started a few months ago when I noticed swelling and discomfort in my left testicle. It's been painful off and on ever since. Then, in November, I started having pain in my upper right leg. I thought it was from skateboarding, but it didn't go away. doctor: I see. And when did you start feeling more fatigued? patient: In December, I noticed I was getting tired more easily. I used to work out regularly, but I didn't have the energy anymore. I've also lost 10 pounds since then, and my appetite has decreased. doctor: That's concerning. Did you experience any other symptoms? patient: Yes, I had night sweats and a cough in December. I was treated with Augmentin, but they didn't go away. I also started taking Accutane for acne in December, but I stopped on February 19th. doctor: I see. Now, let's talk about the more recent events. You mentioned you had severe pain in your right groin and lower quadrant on February 19th. What happened then? patient: I woke up with severe pain and went to the emergency room. They found an elevated white blood cell count and did a CT scan of my abdomen. The scan showed a large clot in my inferior vena cava extending to my right iliac and femoral veins. doctor: That sounds serious. What happened next? patient: I underwent angioplasty, placement of a vena caval filter, and mechanical and pharmacologic thrombolysis. A repeat ultrasound on February 20th showed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis. doctor: That's good news. So, you're currently taking Lovenox, Coumadin, Protonix, Vicodin, and Levaquin. Are there any allergies or past surgeries I should be aware of? patient: No known drug allergies, but I do seem to react to certain adhesives. As for past surgeries, I had the thrombosis treatment on February 19th and 20th. doctor: Okay, I've made a note of that. Now, let's discuss your family history. Do you have any relatives with medical conditions? patient: My maternal great-grandmother had deep venous thrombosis in her 40s, and my maternal great-uncle developed leukemia around age 50. My paternal grandfather died of colon cancer at age 73, and adult-onset diabetes runs in both sides of my family. doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. I'll make sure to document it in your medical record. Now, let's move on to your social history. You mentioned you're a student at the University of Denver. What are your living arrangements like? patient: I live in a dorm on campus. My parents live in Breckenridge. I admit to occasionally smoking marijuana and drinking beer with friends. doctor: I understand. Now, let's talk about your current symptoms. You mentioned nausea and constipation related to Vicodin and pain medication. You also have mild to moderate acne. Do you have any other symptoms, like shortness of breath, chest pain, headaches, joint pains, rashes, or extremity pain? patient: No, I don't have any of those symptoms, except for the right leg pain. doctor: That's good to hear.

doctor hey nicholas nice to see you today your pcp looks like he sent you over for a nonhealing foot ulcer on your right foot can you tell me about how long you've had that patient yeah i've had the boot for about six weeks i first noticed it when i put on a pair of shoes that were little bit too tight i felt some burning and some stinging and looked down and saw a blister i did n't think too much of it because it was on the pad of the bottom of my foot around my heel and i just had been walking on the front part of my foot i started to notice a foul smell and my wife mentioned something to me the other day and i noticed my dog was also smelling my socks a lot and so we looked and saw that the blister had become unroofed or the the top part of the skin of the blister became undone and then underneath it was just this really thick soft mushy skin that had a bad smell with some yellow drainage and so and barbara called the primary care doctor who then got me in to see you he started me on some antibiotics about six days ago and i never had any nausea or vomiting but my wife checked my temperature it was about ninety nine point seven and then at one point i had to put on an extra blanket in bed because i had some chills and when i started the antibiotics it started to feel pretty good but we've now noticed that it has turned black around the outside of the wound and i'm getting some cramping in my calf muscle as well and so there was a red streak also that was coming up the front part of my my ankle along the inside portion of my calf muscle and it's super super hot and so they wanted me to take a have have you look at it doctor okay thank you for sharing that history with me and did you complete that course of antibiotics patient i think he called in ten days' worth and i'm on day six or seven right now i know i've got about two or three days left doctor okay and you mentioned that it had some stinging and it was a bit uncomfortable are you experiencing any pain right now patient yeah it was it was stinging initially like i had just done something small but at this point it's it's really like throbbing it's almost like there is a fire poker in the bottom of my foot now and then the inside of my calf muscle is really hard and i've noticed that every time that i push that i feel it all the way up to my knee behind my kneecap and then noticed that i've been coughing a lot the last two days and then i've noticed that i've had like difficult time catching my breath when i'm walking around the house and so it's almost like two different things going on at this point doctor okay so now i see here in your record that you have some that you're diabetic and have some diabetic neuropathy as well how's your blood sugars been running i'm i'm assuming kind of all over the place over the last i'm gon na say probably three or four weeks can you tell me about that patient yeah my my a1c is six point seven it's pretty well controlled doctor okay patient i used to be on an insulin pump and i had an a1c that at one point was like thirteen but we worked with an endocrinologist to get it down to where it's at now i've been six point seven for probably two years now and i rarely have a blood sugar that goes over two hundred i check two or three times a day if i feel weird i'll check it again but i noticed my sugars have probably been trending in the three to four hundreds the last two weeks and then i had one spike at one point at like five or six hundred that got our attention and i think that's also what made my wife call the primary care doc doctor okay now i know this was caused by a new pair of shoes you had mentioned before to your pcp and he relayed this to me that you really like to go on hikes you and your wife have been hiking have you gone to the new trails that that were just opened up here behind the park patient yeah we actually hiked to charlie's bunion about a week before this i've had a new pair of diabetic shoes and inserts i get those every year i changed the inserts every three or four months i mean i've been in cruise control as far as that goes for some time i did get a new pair of shoes the prosthetist told me to check my feet every day for the first week or two which we did i did go hiking about the third or fourth day and i think that might be what caused it as i just went too far when we were hiking but yeah the trails are the trails are gorgeous they're open it's time to to be outside and i'm sorta stuck with this right now doctor absolutely yeah my wife and i like to go back there and and hike those trails as well so i'm gon na do a quick physical exam for your vital signs i do recognize a slight fever however your vitals themselves look good now on your foot exam i do recognize the necrotic wound on your heel as you mentioned it is present it's approximately two by two centimeters i i do recognize the sloughing of the of the tissue as well as what looks like cellulitis around

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a pleasant age-year-old male who presents today for evaluation of a non-healing foot ulcer on his right foot. The patient reports the onset of symptoms approximately 6 weeks ago when he noted a blister on the pad of the bottom of his foot, around his heel. He initially did not think much of it and continued to walk on the front part of his foot. He eventually noticed a foul smell and his wife also noticed it, as well as the dog smelling his socks a lot. He looked at the blister and noted that the top part of the skin had come off, revealing thick, soft, mushy skin with a bad smell and yellow drainage. His primary care doctor started him on antibiotics 6 days ago, which initially made him feel better, but he has since noticed that the wound has turned black around the outside and he is experiencing cramping in his calf muscle. He also noted a red streak coming up the front part of his ankle along the inside portion of his calf muscle, which is very hot. He denies nausea or vomiting, but he did have a low-grade fever and chills at one point. He also reports a new onset of cough and shortness of breath over the past 2 days. The patient has a history of diabetes and diabetic neuropathy. His A1c is 6.7, which has been well-controlled for the past 2 years. He used to be on an insulin pump and had an A1c of 13 at one point, but he worked with an endocrinologist to get it down to its current level. He checks his blood sugar 2-3 times a day and has noticed that his sugars have been trending in the 300-400s the last 2 weeks, with one spike at 500-600. He recently went on a hike to Charlie's Bunion, which he believes may have caused the ulcer. He wears diabetic shoes and inserts, which he changes every 3-4 months. He is an avid hiker and enjoys the new trails that were recently opened behind the park. Vital signs are within normal limits except for a slight fever. Physical exam of the right foot reveals a necrotic wound on the heel, approximately 2 by 2 centimeters, with sloughing of tissue and cellulitis around the area, as well as erythema. An odor is noted from the wound. No bony exposure is appreciated. Bilateral palpable pulses are present femorally and popliteal pulses are present. Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses are not palpable, but are present via Doppler. The patient denies pain with pressure on the affected area of the wound. X-ray of the right foot reveals no evidence of osteomyelitis. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1.

"doctor: Good morning, patient. I understand you're here for a dietary consultation during your pregnancy due to gestational diabetes. patient: Yes, that's right. I had gestational diabetes with my first pregnancy and had to use insulin. I'm not really sure what ketones are. doctor: I see. Well, ketones are a type of acid that can build up in your blood when you don't have enough insulin or when your blood sugar is too high. This can be dangerous for you and your baby, so it's important to manage your blood sugar levels carefully. patient: Okay. I'll try my best. I've been walking my daughter to school and back home each day, which takes about 40 minutes total. I'm not a big milk drinker, but I do try to drink some. doctor: That's great! Exercise and a healthy diet are both important for managing gestational diabetes. I'm glad to hear you're making an effort to stay active. doctor: Let's take a look at your blood sugar records from the last week. Your fasting blood sugars have been ranging from 92 to 104, with an average of 97. Your two-hour postprandial breakfast readings have been ranging from 172 to 196, with an average of 181. Your two-hour postprandial lunch readings have been ranging from 149 to 189, with an average of 168. And your two-hour postprandial dinner readings have been ranging from 109 to 121, with an average of 116. Your overall average is 140. patient: That's a lot of numbers. What does it all mean? doctor: Well, your blood sugar levels are a bit high, which is why we need to make some adjustments to your diet and insulin regimen. I'm going to provide you with a 2300-calorie meal plan that includes three meals and three snacks per day. The snacks were added last week due to the presence of ketones in your urine. We'll also need to increase your insulin dosage. patient: Okay. I'll follow your instructions. doctor: Good. I'm also going to give you a copy of the Lily Guide for Meal Planning. This will help you make healthy choices and track your carbohydrate intake. patient: Thank you. I appreciate your help. doctor: You're welcome. I'm here to help you have a healthy pregnancy. doctor: I'd like you to work with the following meal plan with a carbohydrate budget representing approximately 45% of the calories from carbohydrates. For breakfast, you can have three carbohydrate servings. For your morning snack, you can have one carbohydrate serving. For lunch, you can have four carbohydrate servings. For your afternoon snack, you can have one carbohydrate serving. For supper, you can have four carbohydrate servings. And for your bedtime snack, you can have one carbohydrate serving. I'd also like you to include some solid protein with each of your meals as well as with the bedtime snack. You should also try to include three servings of dairy products per day to meet your nutritional needs for calcium during pregnancy. And finally, I recommend including a fruit or a vegetable with most of your meals. patient: That sounds like a lot of food! doctor: It is important to eat enough calories to support your pregnancy, but you also need to be mindful of your carbohydrate intake. That's why it's important to follow the meal plan and to test your blood sugar regularly. patient: I will. doctor: Good. I'm also going to increase your insulin dosage. In the morning, you'll take 24 units of 70/30 insulin, and in the evening, you'll take 16 units. patient: Okay. doctor: I want you to call me if your blood sugar levels are outside of the range of over 90 fasting and over 120 two-hour postprandial. patient: I will. doctor: Good.

"doctor: Hello, patient. I understand you've been experiencing some health issues. Can you tell me what's been going on? patient: Well, doctor, it all started about a year and a half ago. I was walking from the bedroom to the living room when suddenly my legs gave out from under me. I felt a bit lightheaded and confused, but I was still aware of my surroundings. I managed to get up shortly after, and according to my son, I seemed to return to normal. doctor: Interesting. And since then, have you had any similar episodes? patient: Yes, unfortunately. On July 3rd, 2008, my legs gave out again, but this time without any lightheadedness. I was rushed to the hospital, where they diagnosed me with pneumonia. They said the fall was likely caused by the infection. After that, I started using a walker to get around, as I couldn't walk the two miles I used to each day. doctor: I see. So, you've had multiple falls and have been using a walker since July 2008. patient: That's right. In August of 2008, I had another fall with no lightheadedness. Pneumonia was again the culprit, and I was admitted to the hospital. After rehabilitation, I was able to use my walker again, but I never fully regained my pre-July baseline. doctor: I understand. And then in October of 2008, you had another fall, which was associated with pneumonia and shingles. patient: Yes, that's correct. I'm currently in a Chronic Rehabilitation Unit because I can no longer use a walker and rely on a wheelchair for mobility. doctor: I see. Now, you mentioned numbness in your hands. Can you tell me more about that? patient: It started about three weeks ago. My hands have been numb, involving all the fingers. I've also noticed muscle bulk loss and general weakness in my hands. However, I must say that my hand strength hasn't been normal since July 2008, but it's definitely getting worse. doctor: I see. And have you experienced any other symptoms, such as fasciculations, cramps, problems with swallowing, or breathing difficulties? patient: I have been having fasciculations in my legs, both in the lower legs and thighs, since August 2008. I don't have any cramps, swallowing problems, or breathing difficulties, though. doctor: That's good to know. How about bowel and bladder control? Any issues there? patient: I've been experiencing constipation alternating with diarrhea, but I haven't lost control of either my bowels or bladder. doctor: Okay. And you mentioned some blood pressure drops and presyncopal episodes when standing. Can you elaborate on that? patient: Yes. I've had some problems with blood pressure drops, and I do feel presyncopal when I stand. doctor: I see. And you've also noticed a loss of feeling in your feet, which have been feeling numb and sponge-like for about nine months. Is that correct? patient: That's right. Additionally, I've lost joint position sense in my feet for approximately nine months. doctor: Thank you for sharing all this information, patient.

"doctor: Hello Mr./Ms. patient, I'm Dr. doctor. I understand you're here today for multiple issues. Can you tell me more about what's been going on? patient: Well, I've been having gross hematuria again. It just started out of nowhere. My Coumadin has been stopped.

I was wondering if I could get some nasal saline spray. doctor: Sure, we can discuss that. But first, let's talk about your Coumadin and the risk of stroke in the setting of atrial fibrillation. patient: Okay. doctor: (Examines the patient's chart) Your vitals are as noted in the chart. You're alert, pleasant, and cooperative. You're not in any apparent distress and you're comfortable in a seated position. I won't be examining you further today. doctor: (Addressing the patient's concerns) For the hematuria, we need to stop the Coumadin so we can evaluate what's going on. It's probably just BPH. We'll also get a repeat UA since you mentioned some dysuria. However, I don't think that would account for the gross hematuria. We'll start you on aspirin 81 mg once a day by mouth. doctor: For the pain, we'll try you on Lortab. You'll get one Lortab 5/500 mg every morning before getting out of bed. You can have a few more throughout the day if you need them. doctor: We'll also see about setting you up with massage therapy and/or physical therapy for your back pain. doctor: And for your sinuses, we'll arrange for you to have saline nasal spray at the bedside for use as needed. patient: Okay, that sounds good.

I do have some intermittent pain beneath the upper portion of the incision and in the right lower quadrant below my ostomy. It's not constant, but it can be quite bothersome at times. doctor: I see. And what have you been doing to manage the pain? patient: I've been taking Percocet, which works well. But I ran out, and I've been trying extra strength Tylenol, which sometimes helps. doctor: Okay. Well, I can give you a refill for the Percocet, but I want you to start weaning yourself off of it. I'd like you to try taking ibuprofen or Tylenol first, and only take the Percocet if the pain is severe. patient: Okay, I can do that. doctor: Good. Now, I also want to talk to you about your diet. You mentioned that you've been having some questions about what you can and cannot eat with your ileostomy. patient: Yes, that's right. I'm not sure what foods are safe to eat and which ones to avoid. doctor: Well, there are a few things you should keep in mind. First, you should avoid foods that are high in fiber, such as fruits and vegetables. These foods can cause diarrhea and cramping. You should also avoid foods that are high in fat, such as fried foods and fatty meats. These foods can slow down digestion and cause constipation. patient: I see. So, what can I eat? doctor: There are plenty of foods that you can eat. You can eat bananas, rice, toast, cheese, and peanut butter. These foods are all low in fiber and fat, and they're easy to digest. You can also eat lean meats, fish, and eggs. Just be sure to cook them thoroughly. patient: Okay, that sounds doable. doctor: Good. I'm also going to give you a list of foods to avoid. Please be sure to read it carefully. patient: I will. doctor: Now, I also want to talk to you about the numbness in your right hand and arm. This is likely due to positioning during surgery.

This can cause pain, weakness, and paresthesias in your arms and hands. patient: I see. doctor: I've discussed the diagnosis, prognosis, natural history, nonoperative, and operative treatment options with you today. We can continue with nonoperative management, such as physical therapy, or we can add cervical epidural steroid injections. We can also consider surgical intervention. patient: I'm not sure what to do. doctor: I understand. It's a big decision. I want to make sure you have all the information you need to make an informed choice. patient: Okay. doctor: Well, let's talk about the surgical option in more detail. The procedure would involve C4-5, C5-6 anterior cervical decompression and fusion. This would involve removing the bone and tissue that is compressing your spinal cord and nerve roots, and then fusing the vertebrae together to stabilize the spine. patient: What are the risks of surgery? doctor: There are some risks associated with surgery, including bleeding, infection, neurovascular injury, dural tear, singular or multiple muscle weakness, paralysis, hoarseness of voice, difficulty swallowing, pseudoarthrosis, adjacent segment disease, and the risk of this given your relatively young age. patient: That's a lot to consider. doctor: I know it is. But I want you to know that I'm confident that this surgery can help to improve your symptoms. patient: I appreciate that. doctor: You're welcome. I also want to discuss the option of disk arthroplasty. This is a newer procedure that involves replacing the damaged disk with an artificial disk. This can help to preserve motion in the spine. patient: That sounds interesting. doctor: It is. But it's important to note that disk arthroplasty is not always successful. And it's not clear whether it's better than traditional surgery in the long run. patient: I see. doctor: So, ultimately, the decision of whether or not to have surgery is up to you. I'm here to answer any questions you have and to help you make the best decision for your health. patient: Thank you. I appreciate that. doctor: You're welcome. So, what are your thoughts? patient: I think I'd like to proceed with the surgery. doctor: Okay. I'm glad to hear that. We'll schedule your surgery for August 1st. In the meantime, you'll need to complete some preoperative testing. patient: Okay. I'll do that. doctor: Good. I'm confident that this surgery will help you to get back to your old self. patient: Thank you. I hope so too.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Follow-up regarding cervical spinal stenosis.

"doctor: Good morning, Mr. Smith. I understand you've been experiencing a decreased level of consciousness. Can you tell me a little bit about what's been going on? patient: Well, I'm not really sure. I've been feeling really tired and weak for the past day or so.

regularly so those readings first off were you able to get the blood pressure cuff patient i was i have n't been great about taking it but i did get the blood pressure cuff doctor so the time that you

they're usually the one thirties sometimes i get i do go into one forties and once it went to like one fifty doctor okay patient and then the bottom number has been between seventy and eighty okay

you trying to lower your salt intake to like like twenty three hundred milligrams a a day so have you been able to do that patient trying my best but doc i really like my french fries doctor yeah patient like doctor we we all like we all like the french fries you know but you know we we we we also do n't like strokes so we do n't want to have a scope and all the all the french fries so that's

and have you been taking that metformin everyday patient i do doctor okay patient i do take it doctor that that that that's really good alright so let me do a quick physical exam on you just a couple

Your chest X-ray shows that you have a pericardial effusion, which is a buildup of fluid around your heart. patient: What does that mean? doctor: It means that the sac around your heart is filled with fluid. This can put pressure on your heart and make it difficult to pump blood. In some cases, it can also lead to shortness of breath and chest pain. patient: Is it serious? doctor: It can be, but it depends on the underlying cause.

The scrotum is normal, and there's no erythema or tenderness. Both testes are descended without hydroceles. doctor: I think that the swelling is a mixture of the resolving cellulitis and a suprapubic fat pad. I'm going to recommend that he be treated with Bactrim for a 10-day course at home, bacitracin, or some antibiotics ointment to the penis with each diaper change for the next 2 to 3 weeks, and sitz baths once or twice a day. patient's mother: Okay. I'll do that. doctor: I also want to talk to you about the importance of gently retracting the skin to keep it from adhering again. Because of the prominent suprapubic fat pad, it's more likely to adhere again. patient's mother: I understand. I'll be sure to do that. doctor: Good. I think that patient is going to be just fine. He has a scheduled follow-up appointment with his urologist. He should keep that appointment or follow up sooner if there are any other problems. patient's mother: Thank you, Dr. doctor. I appreciate your help. doctor: You're welcome. I'm glad I could help.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Swelling and fever after circumcision.

"doctor: Hello Mr. ABCD, I'm Dr. doctor, the oncologist that you'll be seeing today. I understand that you've been diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer. I'm sorry to hear that. patient: Thank you, Doctor. It's been a tough few weeks. doctor: I can imagine. Can you tell me a little bit about your symptoms? patient: Well, it all started about two months ago. I started having some pain in my left flank. I didn't think much of it at first, but it gradually got worse. Eventually, I went to the emergency room, and they did a CT scan. That's when they found the mass in my adrenal gland. doctor: I see. And since then, you've been transferred here to XYZ Hospital for further evaluation? patient: Yes, that's right. doctor: I've reviewed your medical records, and I see that you've had a CT scan of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis. The results showed a mass in your right paratracheal region, as well as several other suspicious lesions. patient: So, what does that mean? doctor: Well, it means that the cancer has spread to other parts of your body. This is what we call metastatic cancer. patient: (Sighs) I see. doctor: I know this is a lot to take in. I'm here to answer any questions you have. patient: Thank you. I appreciate that. doctor: You're welcome. So, what are your main concerns right now? patient: Well, I'm worried about whether this is curable. doctor: I understand. Unfortunately, metastatic lung cancer is not curable. However, it is treatable. patient: (Sighs) I see. doctor: I know this is difficult news to hear. But I want to assure you that we're going to do everything we can to help you. patient: Thank you. I appreciate that. doctor: You're welcome. So, let's talk about your treatment options. patient: Okay. doctor: The main treatment for metastatic lung cancer is chemotherapy.
