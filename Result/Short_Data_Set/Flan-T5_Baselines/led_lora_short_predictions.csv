Radiographs confirmed comminuted tibial tubercle avulsion fracture with patella alta. Surgery is recommended to the grandmother and subsequently to the father by phone.

"Doctor: Good afternoon, who's the victim today, sir? Is it you, or your daughter? Guest_family: Good afternoon, doctor. It's my daughter today. Doctor: Remind me, how old is she? Patient: I'm thirteen, sir. Doctor: So, what happened? My nurses tell me she fell today. Patient: Yeah, I fell off the swing at school earlier this afternoon at about one thirty. Doctor: Where does it hurt, young lady? Patient: It's really bad here on my left elbow. Doctor: Which hand do you write with? Patient: I use my right hand for everything, thank goodness for that. Doctor: Before seeing me, have you seen anyone else? Guest_family: Yeah, we went to an Urgent Care and she had an x ray there. Doctor: What else did they do? Guest_family: They said her arm was broken, and they tried to do a reduction. Doctor: Do you have those x rays with you right now? Guest_family: Yeah, I have them right here, take a look, please. Doctor: Well, these x rays show an incarcerated medial epicondyle fracture, as well as a mildly angulated radial shaft break. Patient: What does that mean? Doctor: Well, in short, you broke the inside part of your elbow. In addition to the pain, do you have any burning or tingling feelings in that arm? Patient: Yes, I do. Doctor: Did you have this before they tried to do a reduction? Patient: No, I didn't, this is new. Doctor: Is this feeling getting worse? Patient: Yes, it is. Doctor: Okay, guys, there is a lot of pressure on that ulnar nerve because of the break and the attempted reduction. Guest_family: What should we do? Doctor: We need to do an O R I F procedure A S A P. I'll reduce that radial shaft fracture at the same time. Guest_family: O R I F? What's that Doctor: I'll put some pins in the elbow, in order to stabilize the break, and we can start the healing process. Guest_family: Will this not heal on its own? Doctor: No, we need to do the surgery. Guest_family: Okay, what are the risks of infection with the surgery? Doctor: Historically, its less than one percent. Guest_family: How is this possible? Doctor: We use prophylactic antibiotics, this helps us control for infection the entire time. Guest_family: Will she be asleep for this? Doctor: Yes, she won't feel a thing. Guest_family: Will she need this hardware taken out in the future? Doctor: Yes, in about a year or two, after everything is healed up nicely. The other risks include bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, and hardware failure. I see good results from my surgeries so I would not worry about these things, but I must disclose. Guest_family: Okay, yes, we'd like to do the surgery.","The patient is a 13-year-old right-hand dominant girl, who fell off a swing at school around 1:30 today. The patient was initially seen at an outside facility and brought here by her father, given findings on x-ray, a closed reduction was attempted on the left elbow. After the attempted reduction, the patient was noted to have an incarcerated medial epicondyle fracture as well as increasing ulnar paresthesias that were not present prior to the procedure. Given this finding, the patient needed urgent open reduction and internal fixation to relieve the pressure on the ulnar nerve. At that same time, the patient's mildly angulated radial shaft fracture will be reduced. This was explained to the father. The risks of surgery included the risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, need for later hardware removal, and possible continuous nerve symptoms. All questions were answered. The father agreed to the above plan.","The patient is a thirteen-year-old girl who fell off the swing at school earlier this afternoon and broke her left elbow. She was taken to an Urgent Care, where she had an x-ray, and they tried to do a reduction, but it was unsuccessful, so they decided to do an O R I F procedure A S A P. The patient has an incarcerated medial epicondyle fracture, as well as a mildly angulated radial shaft fracture. She will have pins placed in the elbow, in order to stabilize the break, and we can start the healing process. She has no burning or tingling feelings in that arm, but she does have a lot of pressure on the ulnar nerve, which is causing her to have a burning sensation in her left arm. She also has a burning and tingly sensation on her left forearm, which she says is new to her. She does not have any pain in her right arm, and she does not use her right hand for writing. She uses her left hand for everything, except for writing and typing. She is currently in the ER with her mother, who is a nurse, and her daughter is thirteen years old. The family has been to the ER, where they were told that her daughter's arm was broken, and that she had a reduction attempt, but that the reduction was unsuccessful. They went to the hospital, and the ER was unable to do the reduction, so she was referred to a surgeon, who performed the surgery. The surgery was performed by a resident, who did not have a history of trauma to the elbow. He is a surgeon. He has no prior history of injury. He does have some history of pain in his left elbow, but he has no history of any previous trauma to his arm. He uses his right arm for everything. He writes with his right hand. He also uses his left arm for writing, and he uses it for everything except for typing and writing with his left hand. His left arm is very painful. He says that he has a very bad pain in the left arm, which he has been experiencing for the last few days. He said that she fell at school today. She had an attempt to reduce the fracture, but the reduction did not go well. The fracture is incarcerated, and there is a radial shaft break. He will have a pin placed in her elbow to stabilize it. The elbow will not heal on its own, and it will need to be surgically repaired. There is no risk of infection with this procedure. The other risks include bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, and hardware failure. I see good results from my surgeries so I would not worry about these things, but I must disclose.

Doctor: Good, what seems to be the problem today? Guest_family: He keeps complaining about the back of his legs being tight. Doctor: Can you sit on the table, young man? Yes, I'm bending his legs, we call this the popliteal angle, and both sides flex to only about twenty. Guest_family: Where should that be normally? Doctor: He should be able to get to ninety. Guest_family: What can we do about this? Doctor: I think we should do surgery on this leg. How does he walk? Can I see? Guest_family: Well, just look at him. Doctor: Yes, he does not walk with a crouched pattern, but he is toe walking. Guest_family: Can we correct that instead of the hamstring tightness? Doctor: Well, I believe he should have surgery on the hamstring, as well. Guest_family: Okay, right now we want to do surgery to fix his walking. What are the risks of infection? Doctor: They're low, historically, they're less than one percent. The risks include anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and the motion of walking, and it may also not always cure the toe walking. There is also possible stiffness after wearing the cast and other cast issues. Guest_family: Okay, and will be under anesthesia during this? Is this worth it?

I have been using it every other night. Doctor: How much uninterrupted sleep do you think that you get per night? Patient: Maybe two to five hours, on a good night. Doctor: That is not enough sleep. No wonder you are falling asleep at work. I recommend following up again with Doctor X regarding your sleep apnea. You are at a much higher risk for obesity and high cholesterol if you continue to not address the issues you have been having with the lack of sleep and sleep apnea. Patient: Okay.

"Doctor: Hello, miss. What brings you into our clinic today? Also, before we start, it looks like you forgot to fill out your ethnicity on the new patient paperwork. Do you mind telling me what you identify as? Patient: Hello, doctor. I am white and I am a young sixty two years old. I have a list of issues I would like to talk about. Doctor: Let's begin. I know that you have been dealing with hypertension and lipometabolism disorder. Doctor X Y Z and I follow you on the hypertension. What else do we have going on? Patient: First off I have a history of diabetes in my family. My father had it and my brother has it currently. I am afraid because I know I have gained some weight. My knee also has been hurting for a long time. The left knee. Doctor: Can you locate where the pain is? Patient: I think it is everywhere in the knee. It hurts to kneel. I had imaging done on it a while ago. Can you check to see the results? Doctor: Ah, yes. We have on file that you had an X Ray done in nineteen ninety nine. I see that a joint is narrowing. We can talk about possible surgery. Patient: Can I have it x rayed again? I don't want any surgery, but I want to know what is going on. I am afraid of surgery. Doctor: Let's see what else I can do. Any other issues? Patient: Yes. I am very concerned because my poop is baby yellow and I have some rectal bleeding occasionally. It is always bright red and drips into the toilet. My last colonoscopy was in nineteen ninety nine. Doctor: Do you have any history of colon cancer? Patient: I do not, but I think my mother did. She is gone now, so I cannot check. Do you think my poop is baby yellow because of my stomach pain? I have some stomach pain and have been laying off the fast food and soda, but it doesn't seem to work. Sometimes my poop is hard or runny. It is always random. Doctor: Do you bleed when the stool is hard? Patient: Not really. Oh, and lastly, I had cold symptoms. Like a sore throat and I was sneezing a lot. I think it was a cold or flu because Claritin did not work. I think the body aches were also from this illness. I feel okay today, but I wanted to bring this up just in case it had to do with my stool being discolored. During this sick period I also am wondering if I have sleep apnea because I wake up in the middle of the night randomly. Doctor: Do you snore? That is a sign of sleep apnea. Smoking also can contribute to restlessness. Patient: No I do not snore and I do not smoke.","The patient is a 62-year-old white female with multiple chronic problems including hypertension and a lipometabolism disorder. She follows with Dr. XYZ on her hypertension, as well as myself. She continues to gain weight. Diabetes is therefore a major concern. In fact, her dad had diabetes and she has a brother who has diabetes. The patient also has several additional concerns she brings up today. One is that her left knee continues to bother her and it hurts. She cannot really isolate where the pain is, it just seems to hurt through her knee. She has had this for some time now and in fact as we reviewed her records, her left knee has been x-rayed in 1999. There was some minimal narrowing of the weightbearing joint with some minor hypertrophic spurring medially. She would like to have this x-rayed again today.

It is bright red. She had a colonoscopy done in 1999. She does have a family history of colon cancer questionable in her mother, who is deceased. She complains of some diffuse abdominal pain off and on. She has given up fast foods and her pop and this has not seemed to help. She does admit however, that she is not eating right. Sometimes her stools are hard. Sometimes they are runny. The blood does not really seem to be related to necessarily a hard stool. It is always bright red and will sometimes drip into the toilet. Over the last couple of days, she had also been sneezing and has had an itchy throat. She tried some Claritin and this did not help. She has had some body aches. She is finally feeling better today with this. She also is questioning whether she has some sleep apnea. She will awaken suddenly in the middle of the night. She was told that she does snore. She does not smoke. As stated, she has gained significant weight.","The patient is white, sixty two years old. She has a history of diabetes, hypertension and lipometabolism disorder.

Doctor: I can see that. Have you seen someone about your thumb before? Patient: I have. These are the notes from that visit. Here you go. Doctor: Thank you. It looks liked you were diagnoses with stenosing tendinosis, which is trigger finger. Patient: Is that common for a fifty one year old woman like me? Doctor: Yeah, it is. We can proceed by releasing the A one pulley? Patient: Could you describe what that means? Could you also go over the risks and benefits of the surgery? Doctor: Of course. I'll explain it and give it to you in writing. Patient: Thank you. I'll most likely agree to it.

"Doctor: I hear someone has a birthday coming up, how old are you turning, ma'am? Patient: I'll be ninety later this month, doctor. Doctor: You're here for a follow up not very long after your first visit. What seems to be the problem today? Patient: Well, actually, my high blood pressure and right arm symptoms are basically gone. Doctor: Great, I saw your blood pressure reading for today, and it's much better. Are you taking the higher dose of Mavik we recommended? Patient: No, I'm not taking that right now. Doctor: How did you tolerate the higher dose? Patient: I didn't feel well at all, so I just went back to the old dose. Doctor: That was one M G per day, correct? Patient: Yes, doctor. I do think I could have some white coat high blood pressure. Doctors' offices make me nervous. Doctor: That does happen. Here, try this sample of Tarka, please. Patient: What is this for, doctor? Doctor: Well, since you're taking the Mavik plus verapamil, you can switch over to Tarka, which is the combined version of the two drugs. Patient: I can't take these, doctor. They're too big. Guest_family: Hello doctor, I'm her daughter. Just so you know, we check her blood pressure at home periodically and it's always similar to that reading. Doctor: Good, so back to that right arm, how is that doing today? Patient: Well, that pain is basically gone now, I think it had to do with that muscle problem back in my right shoulder blade. Doctor: Did you have x rays taken today? Patient: Yes, the tech brought me back right before you came in. Doctor: Good, I have the images right here. Patient: What do they show, doctor? Doctor: Well, these x rays of the neck and right shoulder show some degenerative changes, and possibly some kind of rotator cuff injury. Patient: What makes you think there's an injury? Doctor: Well, look right here. The humeral head is pretty high in the glenoid in the right shoulder, but do you have any pain here? Patient: No, none. Doctor: Then we won't worry about it. Patient: I am having this stomach pain though, doctor. Doctor: How has this pain developed and progressed recently? Patient: Well, it's improved somewhat with me not taking Aleve anymore. Doctor: What medicines are you taking right now, then? Patient: Right know, I'm just taking Tylenol as needed. That seems to be enough for me. Doctor: Do you think this could be acid reflux, or heartburn? Patient: No, but I take Tums, um, three times a day, and Mylanta at night. Oh yeah, I have these sores in my mouth, can you take a look? Doctor: I see. How long have you worn dentures? Patient: Oh I couldn't even tell you, it's been many, many years. Doctor: Do they come and go, the sores? Patient: Yes, one will come, then it'll heal up, then another. Doctor: Okay, we'll keep an eye on it. Patient: And doctor, since I've been taking the Lexapro, I have some tremors on basically my whole body, at least the upper body, like my torso and arms. Doctor: It's hard to tell if you have a tremor today, ma'am, but do you think the Lexapro is helping otherwise? Patient: Yes, we think so.","The patient is an 89-year-old lady. She actually turns 90 later this month, seen today for a short-term followup. Actually, the main reasons we are seeing her back so soon which are elevated blood pressure and her right arm symptoms are basically resolved. Blood pressure is better even though she is not currently on the higher dose Mavik likely recommended. She apparently did not feel well with the higher dose, so she just went back to her previous dose of 1 mg daily. She thinks, she also has an element of office hypertension. Also, since she is on Mavik plus verapamil, she could switch over to the combined drug Tarka. However, when we gave her samples of that she thought they were too big for her to swallow. Basically, she is just back on her previous blood pressure regimen. However, her blood pressure seems to be better today. Her daughter says that they do check it periodically and it is similar to today's reading. Her right arm symptoms are basically resolved and she attributed that to her muscle problem back in the right shoulder blade. We did do a C-spine and right shoulder x-ray and those just mainly showed some degenerative changes and possibly some rotator cuff injury with the humeral head quite high up in the glenoid in the right shoulder, but this does not seem to cause her any problems. She has some vague 'stomach problems', although apparently it is improved when she stopped Aleve and she does not have any more aches or pains off Aleve. She takes Tylenol p.r.n., which seems to be enough for her. She does not think she has any acid reflux symptoms or heartburn. She does take Tums t.i.d. and also Mylanta at night. She has had dentures for many, many years and just recently I guess in the last few months, although she was somewhat vague on this, she has had some sores in her mouth. They do heal up, but then she will get another one. She also thinks since she has been on the Lexapro, she has somewhat of a tremor of her basically whole body at least upper body including the torso and arms and had all of the daughters who I not noticed to speak of and it is certainly difficult to tell her today that she has much tremor. They do think the Lexapro has helped to some extent.","The patient is a 90-year-old woman with high blood pressure and right arm pain. She has been taking the Mavik plus verapamil, which is the combined version of the two drugs. She is also taking Tylenol as needed for her stomach pain, and she is taking Tums, Mylanta, and Tums three times a day. She also has a history of acid reflux, and heartburn, but she is not having any stomach pain at this time. She does, however, have some pain in her right shoulder, which has been improving somewhat since she stopped taking Aleve. The humeral head is pretty high in the glenoid in the right shoulder and rotator cuff injury. She had x rays taken today, and they show some degenerative changes in her neck and right shoulder. She was also given an x-ray of the neck and shoulder, and the x-rays showed some degeneration of the rotator ct and humeral heads. She did not have any pain in this area at the time of her first visit, but it has improved somewhat since then. She continues to have some lower back pain, but that has improved a bit since she started taking the Lexapro. She's also been taking a lower dose of Tarka, and that seems to be helping her with the lower arm pain as well. The patient has some tremors on the upper body, but no tremor, and is not taking the higher dose of the drug, which she was prescribed at the beginning of the visit. She takes Tarkasil, and has not been taking any other than the lower dose, which was one M G per day for the first few days, and now she's taking one MG per day, and one Mg per day at home. She doesn't have any tremors at home, and her blood pressure at home is very similar to the reading she had when she first came in today. Just so you know, we check her at home periodically and it's always similar to that reading. We don't think she has any tremor at home or at the hospital. We do think she may have some white coat tremor. We'll keep an eye on it. She seems to have no pain in the stomach, and no stomach pain. No pain in that area. She says she has some pain with her right arm, but has no pain with the left arm. She hasn't had any pain with that pain since she's been on Aleve for a few months. She said she's not taking any pain relievers at home at all. She just takes Tums as needed. No other medications."

Going back to your list of medications, I know you took antibiotics for your infection, but did you take any medication for your sinuses? Patient: No, I haven't. I did try this cream for my nose, but that didn't work either. Nothing worked! Doctor: I see. Looks like the cream you used was a topical nasal corticosteroid. Are there any other symptoms that you have been experiencing? Patient: I've had some trouble with my balance, and I feel like I've lost some of my hearing. I thought this was odd since I'm only fifty years old. I think my ears felt plugged or full of air, so they just needed to pop. Doctor: I see. Let's perform an audiogram test to check your ears. Patient: Sounds good. Doctor: I'm seeing that you have some mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Your tympanometry seems to be normal. Your speech discrimination was also normal. Patient: That's reassuring. Doctor: I want to ask a few more questions about your ears. Do you feel any fullness or pressure? Patient: No, I don't feel anything like that right now. Doctor: Do you hear any humming, buzzing, or roaring sounds? Patient: Nope. I don't hear anything like that. Doctor: We checked your ears and now understand more about the problem, but I wonder why your balance is affected. When did you start noticing your balance was affected? Patient: I think it could have been to this one medicine that starts with an A. I forgot the name, but it didn't really help my nasal problems. It just made my balance worse. Doctor: Was the medicine called Allegra? Patient: Oh, yeah. That's what it was called. I thought I had some sort of allergy, so I thought it would help. Doctor: I see. Did you ever feel any dizziness too? Patient: Yeah, I did. Doctor: I will have you do some movements to see if your dizziness occurs. Patient: Sounds good. Doctor: Could you look to the left and then look to the right. Patient: Oh, wow. That made me very dizzy. Doctor: Looks like sudden movements and head turning make your dizziness worse.","I had the pleasure of meeting and evaluating the patient referred today for evaluation and treatment of chronic sinusitis. As you are well aware, she is a pleasant 50-year-old female who states she started having severe sinusitis about two to three months ago with facial discomfort, nasal congestion, eye pain, and postnasal drip symptoms. She states she really has sinus problems, but this infection has been rather severe and she notes she has not had much improvement with antibiotics. She had a CT of her paranasal sinuses identifying mild mucosal thickening of right paranasal sinuses with occlusion of the ostiomeatal complex on the right and turbinate hypertrophy was also noted when I reviewed the films and there is some minimal nasal septum deviation to the left. She currently is not taking any medication for her sinuses. She also has noted that she is having some problems with her balance and possible hearing loss or at least ear popping and fullness. Her audiogram today demonstrated mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss, normal tympanometry, and normal speech discrimination. She has tried topical nasal corticosteroid therapy without much improvement. She tried Allegra without much improvement and she believes the Allegra may have caused problems with balance to worsen. She notes her dizziness to be much worse if she does quick positional changes such as head turning or sudden movements, no ear fullness, pressure, humming, buzzing or roaring noted in her ears. She denies any previous history of sinus surgery or nasal injury. She believes she has some degree of allergy symptoms.","Nasal sinus problems. Patient: I had a severe sinus infection two to three months ago. I thought I just had some nasal problems. I was given some antibiotics. I forgot the name, but it didn't really help. It just made my nasal problems worse. I did try this cream for my nose, but that didn't work either. I also tried a topical nasal corticosteroid. It didn't seem to help at all. I felt like my symptoms were the same. My face would feel uncomfortable, my nose was stuffy, my eyes hurt, and I felt something dropping in the back of my throat. I would feel like my nose felt plugged or full of air, so they just needed to pop. I didn't feel any fullness or pressure in my nose or ears. I just felt like I had some stuffy nose, and my eyes felt like they were full of stuffy and my face felt uncomfortable. I have been having some trouble with my balance for the last few months. I think it could have been to this one medicine that starts with an A. Could you explain them to me? Doctor: Antibiotics are usually used to fight infections. I see here it says you were given antibiotics, correct? Patient: Yes, I was, but I don't know what those are. Doctor: Was the medicine called Alleg? I see it starts with a A. Did you ever feel any dizzy? Did you have any symptoms of sinusitis? I can't remember if you had any symptoms at all, but did you ever see if you were prescribed any medication for your sinuses? I think that you had some sinus inflammation. I can see that you have some nasal sinus obstruction. You also had some obstruction in your right ostiomeatal complex and excess growing of some of the bones in your nose. Your nasal septum was shifted to the left. You had some thickening of the mucosal layer in your paranasal sinis. Your speech discrimination was also normal. Your tympanometry seems to be normal. You have some mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Your hearing discrimination was normal. Did your doctor order any advanced imaging's? Did your previous doctor order a C T scan of your nose? Did he or she order a CT scan? Did she see any changes in your sinus? She did not see any change in the sinus, but she did see that your nasal sinuses were shifted. She also saw that your nose was shifted slightly to the right. She said that she didn't see any signs of obstruction. She did see some changes in her sinuses. She was given antibiotics for her sinus. Do you remember if the antibiotics helped? Patient was given any medication to fight the infection. Did she remember if she was prescribed any other medications for her nasal problems? She didn't remember any. She just thought she had a sinus allergy, so she took a topical steroid. Nothing worked! Doctor: I see. Let's perform an audiogram test to check your ears. Let me take a look. Your audiogram results are normal. Are there any other symptoms that you are experiencing? You have no other symptoms of hearing loss, and your speech discrimination is normal. Her balance is affected. She has no symptoms of dizziness. She does have some symptoms of nasal congestion. She feels fullness and pressure in her nose and ears. She says she feels like her nose is plugged and her eyes feel like they are full of pressure. She doesn't feel anything like that right now. She thinks she is having some nasal congestion and she has some nasal inflammation. She is having a mild sinus problem."
"Doctor: Good afternoon, sir. My nurse has it written down here that that you're a thirty three year old black male, is that correct? Patient: Yes, doctor, that's correct. Doctor: Great, what seems to be the problem today, sir? Patient: Well, I think I'm having some sexual dysfunction. I was wondering if Cialis would help. Doctor: What makes you think this, sir? Patient: Well, I did a quiz online on the Cialis website and I didn't score in the normal range, so I figured I would come in. Doctor: Is there anything else of note, sir? Patient: Well, there may be some decreased desire, but honestly, I don't think that's the main problem here. I'd like to have my erections last longer, doctor. Doctor: What was this quiz like? Patient: Well, on the quiz, I said that less than half of the time I'm able to get an erection and keep an erection after penetration. Doctor: Are you having difficulty maintaining an erection until completion? Patient: Well, I'd say there's slight difficulty. Doctor: Okay, do you have any significant medical conditions in the past that you have been treated for? Patient: No, not that I know of. Doctor: What about testicular infections? Patient: No, that sounds painful, but no. Doctor: Have you had any traumatic injuries to the groin? Patient: No, not that I can remember. Doctor: What about hernias?
