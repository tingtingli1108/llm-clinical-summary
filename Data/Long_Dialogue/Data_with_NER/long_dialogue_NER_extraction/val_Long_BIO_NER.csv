"doctor: Good morning, patient. Thank you for coming in today. I understand you're here because you've been having ear infections. patient: That's right. I've had them for a while now. doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me a little bit more about them? patient: Well, they usually start with a sore throat and a cough. Then my ears start to hurt and I get a fever. I've been taking antibiotics for them, but they don't seem to be helping. doctor: I see. How long have you been having these ear infections? patient: About a year. doctor: And how many rounds of antibiotics have you taken? patient: Twelve. doctor: I see. That's quite a few. doctor: Has your hearing been affected by the ear infections? patient: Yes. I've been having trouble hearing. doctor: I'd like to take a closer look at your ears. doctor: (Examines the patient's ears with an otoscope.) I see that you have otitis media in both ears. That means that there's an infection in the middle ear. I also see some drainage from your left ear. doctor: I'd also like to do a hearing test. doctor: (Conducts a hearing test.) Your hearing is diminished in both ears. doctor: I'm also going to refer you for an audiometry test. That will give us more information about your hearing loss. doctor: Based on your symptoms and the results of the exam, I think you have suppurative otitis media without spontaneous rupture. I also think you have adenoid hyperplasia. doctor: Adenoid hyperplasia is a condition in which the adenoids, which are small glands located in the back of the throat, become enlarged. This can block the Eustachian tubes, which are the tubes that connect the middle ear to the back of the throat. When the Eustachian tubes are blocked, fluid can build up in the middle ear, which can lead to infection. doctor: I'm going to recommend that you have surgery to place myringotomy tubes in your ears and to remove your adenoids. This surgery is usually done on an outpatient basis, and it's very effective in treating chronic ear infections. patient: What are the risks of the surgery? doctor: The risks of the surgery are low, but they include bleeding, infection, and damage to the eardrum. patient: What are the benefits of the surgery? doctor: The benefits of the surgery are that it will relieve your ear pain, improve your hearing, and prevent future ear infections. patient: I think I'd like to go ahead with the surgery. doctor: Okay. I'll schedule you for surgery next week. doctor: In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe some antibiotics to help clear up the infection. doctor: I'm also going to give you some information about the surgery and how to prepare for it. patient: Thank you. doctor: You're welcome. I'm here if you have any other questions.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Ear infections. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a pleasant age-year-old male who presents for evaluation of recurrent ear infections. He reports having ear infections for approximately one year. The infections typically begin with a sore throat and cough, followed by ear pain and fever. He has taken twelve rounds of antibiotics for the infections, but they have not been effective. The patient also reports hearing loss. On exam, the patient has otitis media in both ears with drainage from the left ear. Hearing testing reveals diminished hearing in both ears. The patient has been diagnosed with suppurative otitis media without spontaneous rupture and adenoid hyperplasia. The patient was advised of the diagnosis and the treatment options. He elected to proceed with surgery to place myringotomy tubes and remove the adenoids. The patient was given information about the surgery and how to prepare for it. He was also prescribed antibiotics to help clear up the infection. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. Suppurative otitis media without spontaneous rupture Assessment: The patient has a history of recurrent ear infections, and the examination shows otitis media in both ears with drainage from the left ear. Plan: - Start the patient on a course of antibiotics to treat the infection. - Refer the patient for an audiometry test to assess the extent of hearing loss. - Schedule the patient for surgery to place myringotomy tubes in the ears and to remove the adenoids. 2. Adenoid hyperplasia Assessment: The patient has adenoid hyperplasia, which is blocking the Eustachian tubes and leading to recurrent ear infections. Plan: - Schedule the patient for surgery to remove the adenoids. 3. Hearing loss Assessment: The patient has hearing loss in both ears, likely due to the recurrent ear infections and adenoid hyperplasia. Plan: - Refer the patient for an audiometry test to assess the extent of hearing loss. - Consider hearing aids if the hearing loss is significant. Follow-up instructions: - The patient will follow up with the ENT surgeon after the surgery to check on the healing and to discuss further management of the hearing loss.",2745,2178,"[{'token': 'ear', 'label': 'B-DISEASE'}, {'token': 'infections', 'label': 'I-DISEASE'}, {'token': 'sore', 'label': 'B-DISEASE'}, {'token': 'throat', 'label': 'I-DISEASE'}, {'token': 'cough', 'label': 'B-DISEASE'}, {'token': 'fever', 'label': 'B-DISEASE'}, {'token': 'ear', 'label': 'B-DISEASE'}, {'token': 'infections', 'label': 'I-DISEASE'}, {'token': 'ear', 'label': 'B-DISEASE'}, {'token': 'infections', 'label': 'I-DISEASE'}, {'token': 'o', 'label': 'B-DISEASE'}, {'token': '##titis', 'label': 'I-DISEASE'}, {'token': 'media', 'label': 'I-DISEASE'}, {'token': 'infection', 'label': 'B-DISEASE'}, {'token': 'hearing', 'label': 'B-DISEASE'}, {'token': 'loss', 'label': 'I-DISEASE'}, {'token': 'o', 'label': 'B-DISEASE'}, {'token': '##titis', 'label': 'I-DISEASE'}, {'token': 'media', 'label': 'I-DISEASE'}, {'token': 'ad', 'label': 'B-DISEASE'}, {'token': '##eno', 'label': 'I-DISEASE'}, {'token': '##id', 'label': 'I-DISEASE'}, {'token': 'h', 'label': 'I-DISEASE'}, {'token': '##yper', 'label': 'I-DISEASE'}, {'token': '##p', 'label': 'I-DISEASE'}, {'token': '##lasia', 'label': 'I-DISEASE'}, {'token': 'Aden', 'label': 'B-DISEASE'}, {'token': '##oid', 'label': 'I-DISEASE'}, {'token': 'h', 'label': 'I-DISEASE'}, {'token': '##yper', 'label': 'I-DISEASE'}, {'token': '##p', 'label': 'I-DISEASE'}, {'token': '##lasia', 'label': 'I-DISEASE'}, {'token': 'infection', 'label': 'B-DISEASE'}, {'token': 'ear', 'label': 'B-DISEASE'}, {'token': 'infections', 'label': 'I-DISEASE'}]","[{'token': 'ear infections', 'label': 'B-DISEASE'}, {'token': 'sore throat', 'label': 'B-DISEASE'}, {'token': 'cough', 'label': 'B-DISEASE'}, {'token': 'fever', 'label': 'B-DISEASE'}, {'token': 'ear infections', 'label': 'B-DISEASE'}, {'token': 'ear infections', 'label': 'B-DISEASE'}, {'token': 'otitis media', 'label': 'B-DISEASE'}, {'token': 'infection', 'label': 'B-DISEASE'}, {'token': 'hearing loss', 'label': 'B-DISEASE'}, {'token': 'otitis media', 'label': 'B-DISEASE'}, {'token': 'adenoid hyperplasia', 'label': 'B-DISEASE'}, {'token': 'Adenoid hyperplasia', 'label': 'B-DISEASE'}, {'token': 'infection', 'label': 'B-DISEASE'}, {'token': 'ear infections', 'label': 'B-DISEASE'}]",[],[]
"doctor: Hello, patient, and welcome to my office. I understand you're here today because you've been having some problems with eating. patient: That's right. Patient's mother: He's become very picky about what he eats, and he's not eating very much in general. doctor: I see. Can you tell me more about what's been going on? patient's mother: Well, he started vomiting after eating raw carrots a few weeks ago. It would happen within 5 to 10 minutes of eating them. He'd complain that his stomach hurt, and then he'd throw up. doctor: And has this happened with any other foods? patient's mother: Yes, it happened again last week after he ate some celery. We haven't given him any of those foods since then. doctor: I see. Does he have any other symptoms, like diarrhea or constipation? patient's mother: No, his bowel movements are normal. doctor: Okay. I'm also curious about his medical history. Does he have any allergies or asthma? patient's mother: He has a history of reactive airway disease, but he's not diagnosed with intrinsic asthma at this time. He doesn't take any medication regularly. doctor: Okay, that's helpful. Let me just take a few measurements. The doctor takes the patient's vital signs and examines his neck, lungs, heart, and abdomen. doctor: Everything looks normal. He's not in any distress and he seems to be doing well. patient's mother: That's good to hear. doctor: I think we can rule out any kind of allergic reaction or obstruction. At this point, the best thing to do is to simply avoid giving him carrots and celery. patient's mother: Okay, we can do that. doctor: In the future, you can certainly try those foods again and see how he tolerates them. I would also encourage you to offer him a wide variety of fruits and vegetables in his diet. patient's mother: I will. doctor: If his symptoms worsen, please don't hesitate to contact me again. patient's mother: Thank you, I will.

"doctor: Hello, patient, I'm Dr. doctor, and I'll be seeing you today. I understand you've been having some health issues lately. Can you tell me a little bit about what's been going on? patient: Sure, doctor. It all started a few months ago when I noticed a swelling and discomfort in my left testicle. I also had pain in my upper right leg, which I initially thought was from skateboarding. I went to physical therapy, and it helped temporarily, but then the pain came back. I started feeling more fatigued and lost 10 pounds since December. I also had night sweats and a cough, so I was treated with Augmentin, but the symptoms didn't go away. doctor: I see. And then recently, you had a severe pain in your right inguinal and right lower quadrant. Is that correct? patient: Yes, that's right. I went to the Emergency Room, and they found a large clot in my inferior vena cava. I underwent angioplasty, placement of a vena caval filter, and mechanical and pharmacologic thrombolysis. The repeat ultrasound showed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis, but I'm still on continuous intravenous unfractionated heparin infusion. doctor: I understand. And they also found that you have acute lymphoblastic leukemia, is that right? patient: Yes, that's what they told me. It was confirmed by flow cytometry of peripheral blood lymphoblasts. doctor: Okay. I've reviewed your medical history and test results. I'd like to proceed with a diagnostic bone marrow aspirate/biopsy and lumbar puncture. We'll also do a reassessment of the status of the deep venous thrombosis with Doppler studies and an ultrasound/Doppler of the testicles. patient: Alright, doctor. What about the treatment for the leukemia? doctor: We'll discuss that once we have the results of the diagnostic tests. In the meantime, we'll continue with therapeutic anticoagulation. patient: Okay, I understand. Thank you, doctor. doctor: You're welcome, patient.

"doctor: Good morning, Mr. Patient. I understand you're here for a follow-up visit regarding your right foot infection. patient: That's right, doctor. doctor: Could you please tell me what brought you to the emergency room in the first place? patient: Well, I was working in my garage a few days ago when I noticed some redness and swelling in my right foot. It started to itch and then the pain and redness got worse, so I went to the emergency room. doctor: I see. Did the emergency room staff tell you what was causing the infection? patient: They said I had cellulitis and a foreign body in my foot. doctor: That's right. We were able to confirm that with an x-ray. The foreign body is likely what caused the infection. patient: How are you going to treat it? doctor: We're going to perform an irrigation debridement to clean out the infection and remove the foreign body. patient: What does that involve? doctor: We'll make a small incision over the infected area and clean out the pus and any dead tissue. We'll also take some cultures to see what kind of bacteria is causing the infection. patient: Okay. And what happens after that? doctor: We'll pack the wound with an antibiotic-impregnated gauze and apply a sterile dressing. You'll need to keep the wound clean and dry and take antibiotics to clear up the infection. patient: How long will it take to heal? doctor: It depends on how severe the infection is. But typically, it takes about 2-4 weeks for the wound to heal completely. patient: Okay. I'll do whatever it takes to get better. doctor: That's the spirit.

"doctor: Hello, Mr./Mrs. patient's last name, I'm Dr. doctor's last name. I understand you've been having some shortness of breath and cough. Can you tell me more about that? patient: Yes, doctor. I've been feeling better overall, with less shortness of breath and cough over the last few days. But I still have some swelling in my lower extremities, and I'm on 4L of oxygen. doctor: Okay, and have you been experiencing any other symptoms, like nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or changes in your bowel habits? patient: No, I haven't had any of those symptoms. doctor: That's good to hear. Now, I see that you have a history of left ventricular systolic dysfunction, pneumonia, recurrent pleural effusions, and non-small cell lung cancer. Can you tell me more about those? patient: Sure. I had an echocardiogram in December 2007 that showed left ventricular systolic dysfunction. I was also hospitalized for pneumonia in December 2007 at XYZ Hospital. I've had recurrent pleural effusions, and I had a pleurodesis and biopsy for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer at XYZ Hospital. doctor: I see. And do you have any known drug allergies? patient: No, I don't have any known drug allergies. doctor: Okay, and what medications are you currently taking? patient: I'm taking amiodarone, diltiazem, enoxaparin, furosemide, methylprednisolone, pantoprazole, Zosyn, and acetaminophen and hydrocodone as needed. doctor: Thank you. Now, I'm going to perform a physical exam to get a better understanding of your condition. doctor: (performs physical exam) doctor: Based on my examination and your medical history, I believe you have mesothelioma versus primary lung carcinoma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, malignant pleural effusion, and anemia of chronic disease. patient: That's a lot to take in. Can you explain what all of that means? doctor: Sure. Mesothelioma is a type of cancer that starts in the lining of the lungs. Primary lung carcinoma is another type of lung cancer that starts in the cells of the lungs. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a condition that causes airflow blockage in the lungs. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is a heart rhythm disorder that causes the heart to beat irregularly. Malignant pleural effusion is a buildup of fluid in the space between the lungs and the chest wall. Anemia of chronic disease is a condition in which the body doesn't make enough red blood cells. patient: I see. And what are the treatment options for these conditions? doctor: The treatment options will depend on the specific type of cancer and the stage of the disease. For mesothelioma, treatment options may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and immunotherapy. For primary lung carcinoma, treatment options may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and targeted therapy. For chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, treatment options may include medications, oxygen therapy, and pulmonary rehabilitation. For paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, treatment options may include medications, catheter ablation, and surgery. For malignant pleural effusion, treatment options may include drainage of the fluid, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. And for anemia of chronic disease, treatment options may include iron supplements, erythropoietin injections, and blood transfusions. patient: That's a lot of information. I'll need some time to process it. doctor: I understand. I'll give you some time to think about it, and we can discuss it further at your next appointment. In the meantime, I'm going to order some tests to get more information about your condition. patient: Okay, thank you, doctor. doctor: You're welcome. I'll see you again soon.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Shortness of breath, cough, and swelling in lower extremities.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a pleasant male who presents for follow-up after shunt surgery. He reports that he is doing better since the surgery. He is now able to walk to the dining room, which he was unable to do before the surgery. His balance has improved, but he still has some problems with it. His bladder control has also improved, but he still wears a diaper and has occasional accidents. His thinking has improved, and he can now have a normal conversation. He denies any headaches or pain at the shunt site. The patient asks about driving again. The physician informs him that it is unlikely that his speed of movement will improve enough for him to pass a driver's safety evaluation. However, the physician states that some patients do surprise him by improving enough over 9 to 12 months to pass such a test. The physician states that he would be happy to recommend such a test if he believes the patient is likely to pass it, but he thinks it is very unlikely that the patient will be able to pass it at this time.

We'll make a few small incisions and insert a camera and surgical instruments to repair the torn meniscus and smooth out the damaged cartilage. patient: How long will the recovery take? doctor: Typically, it takes about 6-8 weeks to recover from this type of surgery. You'll need to use crutches for a few weeks and do physical therapy to regain strength and mobility in your knee. patient: I'm a bit nervous about surgery. Are there any risks? doctor: There are some potential risks, such as infection, bleeding, and blood clots. But these risks are relatively low.

some people when they have them like their parents have them stuff but patient yeah my my dad had kidney stones i think he has passed a couple of them i'm not quite sure doctor alright and have you had any in the past or is this your first one patient this is my first time i've never had this before doctor okay alright so we'll do we'll do an exam on you just to check you out so i guess you were in pain and stuff over the over the easter easter break there that patient yeah yeah i had some pain over the weekend i saw my pediatrician this morning so they sent me over here they were concerned that i might have a kidney stone doctor okay so i'm guessing you did n't get to go find the eggs on the easter egg hunt because of the you were in pain patient not so much but i i got to participate a

kidney okay so we we were able to get a ct of your your side and it showed that you do have a stone measuring point five centimeters in size and it's located in the proximal right ureter and so that's that duck that passes from your kidney to your bladder alright i do n't see any evidence of hydronephrosis so that means that there's not obstructing ureter causing swelling in your kidney which is which is pretty good so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so you do have that kidney stone on the right so what i'm recommending is i want you to push fluids just to help facilitate you passing that stone alright have you been taking in have you been drinking enough water do you think so far patient probably not enough i drink some but doctor okay yeah i i want you to to drink

we can see you wan na know when that that stone does pass gon na order a bmp and a urinalysis and a urine culture and based on what the urinalysis shows we can decide if i can decide if i need to put you on antibiotics if you do have an infection of some kind and i wan na see you back in about a week to two weeks and if you're still having symptoms we can discuss further treatment such as a lithotripsy and it's it's a mainly minimally invasive procedure where we use shock waves to try to break up that stone but otherwise do you have any other questions for me patient no i do n't think so

"doctor: Good morning, Mr. XYZ. I understand you're here today for an Achilles tendon rupture. patient: That's right. I was playing basketball last Wednesday in Angola and felt a pop in my posterior leg. I was seen locally and diagnosed with an Achilles tendon rupture. doctor: I see. And how has the pain been since then? patient: It's been minimal. I've been taking aspirin a day, but other than that, I've just been on crutches and nonweightbearing. doctor: Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about your medical history? patient: I don't have any diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or pulmonary disease. I do take Malarone, an anti-malarial, because I work in Angola. doctor: And what about your social history? patient: I'm a petroleum engineer for Chevron. I drink socially, but I don't use tobacco. doctor: Okay. Let's take a look at your ankle. The doctor examines the patient's ankle. doctor: You have some mild swelling on the right ankle and hindfoot. Your motion is increased into dorsiflexion, and you have good plantarflexion, subtalar, Chopart, and forefoot motion. Your motor function is intact although weak into plantarflexion. Sensation is intact. Pulses are strong. In the prone position, you have diminished tension on the affected side. There is some bruising around the posterior heel. You have a palpable defect about 6-8 cm proximal to the insertion site that is tender for you. Squeezing the calf causes no plantarflexion of the foot. doctor: Based on your examination and history, I believe you have a right Achilles tendon rupture. patient: What does that mean? doctor: It means that the tendon that connects your calf muscle to your heel bone has been torn. patient: How did that happen? doctor: It's usually caused by a sudden, forceful contraction of the calf muscle, like when you're playing sports. patient: So what can we do about it? doctor: We have two options: operative and nonoperative treatment. With nonoperative treatment, we would immobilize your ankle in a cast or boot for 6-8 weeks. With operative treatment, we would surgically repair the tendon. patient: Which option is better? doctor: Operative treatment is generally the preferred option for people who are active and want to return to sports. It has a higher success rate than nonoperative treatment, and it allows you to return to activity sooner. patient: Okay. I think I want to go with operative treatment. doctor: Alright. I'll schedule you for surgery this week. In the meantime, I'm going to put you in a high tide boot and a 1"" lift. You can weight bear until surgery. patient: Thank you, doctor. doctor: You're welcome.

"doctor: Good morning, Mr. Abc. Thank you for coming in today. I understand you've been experiencing some back pain since a motor vehicle accident in 2000. Can you tell me more about that? patient: Sure. I was a passenger in a car that was stopped at a red light when we were rear-ended by another vehicle. I felt immediate pain in my mid-back, and it's been bothering me ever since. doctor: I see. And how has the pain been affecting you? patient: It's mostly an aching pain that gets worse when I sit for too long. I can usually manage it with over-the-counter pain relievers and exercise, but it's still a constant annoyance. doctor: I understand. Have you seen any other doctors or specialists about this? patient: Yes, I've seen a few. I went to the emergency room right after the accident, and they took x-rays and prescribed pain medication. I also saw a physical therapist for a while, but it didn't seem to help much. doctor: I see. Well, I'm going to examine your back and see if I can find anything that might be causing the pain. The doctor performs a physical examination of Mr. Abc's back. doctor: Your range of motion seems to be good, and I don't feel any tenderness or swelling. However, I did notice a slight compression of the T7 and T8 vertebrae on your x-rays. patient: What does that mean? doctor: It means that the bones in your spine have been compressed, which can cause pain and discomfort. It's likely related to the car accident. patient: So, what can we do about it? doctor: Well, there are a few things we can try. First, I'm going to prescribe some stronger pain medication to help manage the pain. I also recommend that you continue with your exercise routine and try to improve your core strength. That can help to stabilize your spine and reduce pain. patient: Okay, I'll do that. doctor: I'm also going to order a bone scan to get a better look at your spine and see if there's anything else going on. patient: Sure, I can do that. doctor: Good. I'll have my nurse schedule the appointment for you. In the meantime, if your pain gets worse or you have any other concerns, please don't hesitate to call my office. patient: Thank you, doctor.

"doctor: Good morning, Mrs. patient, I'm Dr. doctor. I understand you're here for a consultation regarding your recent diagnosis of colon cancer. patient: Yes, that's right. I'm still trying to process everything. doctor: I can imagine. Let's go over your medical history to better understand your situation. You mentioned you started experiencing abdominal cramping in February 2007, is that correct? patient: Yes, it was mild at first, and I wasn't sure if it was related to my pregnancy at the time. Unfortunately, I had a miscarriage around seven weeks. doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Then in late March, you had more severe abdominal cramping. Is that when you decided to seek medical attention? patient: Yes, the pain was much worse, and I was worried. doctor: That's understandable. You underwent a colonoscopy on April 30th, which revealed a near-obstructing lesion at the splenic flexure. The pathology report confirmed colon cancer, although I don't have a copy of that report at the moment. patient: I see. I also had laparoscopic-assisted surgical resection yesterday, and the pathology showed colon adenocarcinoma, low grade, measuring 3.8 x 1.7 cm. It was circumferential and invading into the subserosal mucosa greater than 5 mm. doctor: That's good information. The lymph nodes were negative for metastasis, and there was no angiolymphatic invasion. The radial margin was 0.1 mm, and the other margins were 5 and 6 mm. We're still waiting for the results of the microsatellite instability testing. patient: Okay. What about staging? doctor: We've already done a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. It showed a mass at the splenic flexure with mildly enlarged lymph nodes there. There was no evidence of metastasis to the liver, lungs, or other organs. The scan also noted degenerative changes at L5-S1 and a normal appearance of the ovaries. An intrauterine device (IUD) was present in the uterus. patient: I see. doctor: I understand you've been feeling well overall, with no fevers, night sweats, or lymphadenopathy. You haven't had any cough, shortness of breath, back pain, bone pain, blood in your stool, melena, or change in stool caliber. That's good to hear. patient: Yes, I've been eating well until the surgery. doctor: That's great. I'm glad to hear that. Now, let's talk about your medical history. You have no significant medical problems, but you have had three miscarriages, all at about seven weeks. You have no prior surgeries. patient: That's correct. doctor: Regarding your social history, you smoked cigarettes socially in your 20s, but you don't smoke now. You have two glasses of wine per day, both red and white. You're married with no children, and you work as an esthetician. patient: Yes, that's all accurate. doctor: As for your family history, your father died of stage IV colon cancer at age 45. Your brother died of pancreas cancer at age 44, and another brother had polyps on colonoscopy a couple of years ago. Your mother is 82 and healthy, but she was recently diagnosed with hemochromatosis. patient: Yes, that's all correct. doctor: Okay, let's move on to the physical examination. You're in no acute distress. Your vital signs are stable, and your skin is warm and dry with no jaundice. No cervical or supraclavicular lymph nodes are palpable. Your lungs are clear, and your heart rate is regular. Your abdomen is soft and mildly tender, with clean and dry dressings. There's no peripheral edema, and sequential compression devices (SCDs) are in place. patient: Okay. doctor: Regarding your laboratory data, your white blood count is 11.7, hemoglobin is 12.8, hematocrit is 37.8, platelets are 408, and the differential shows a left shift. Your MCV is 99.6. Sodium is 136, potassium is 4.1, bicarb is 25, chloride is 104, BUN is 5, creatinine is 0.7, and glucose is 133. Calcium is 8.8 and magnesium is 1.8. patient: Got it. doctor: Now, let's talk about the impression and plan. You have a newly diagnosed stage II colon cancer, with a stage T3c, N0, M0 colon cancer, grade 1. You don't have high-risk factors such as high grade or angiolymphatic invasion, and an adequate number of lymph nodes were sampled. Although the tumor was near obstructing, you weren't having symptoms and were having normal bowel movements. patient: I see. doctor: We had a lengthy discussion about your diagnosis and prognosis. Firstly, you have a good prognosis for being cured without adjuvant therapy. I would consider you borderline for chemotherapy given your young age. Referring to the online database, you have a 13% chance of relapse in the next five years, and with aggressive chemotherapy (XLA platinum-based), this would be reduced to an 8% risk of relapse with a 5% benefit. Chemotherapy with a 5-FU-based regimen would have a smaller benefit of around 2.5%. patient: That's a lot of information to take in. doctor: I understand. We can discuss this further during your next visit. For now, the plan is to allow you to recuperate and then meet with you and your husband to discuss the pros and cons of adjuvant chemotherapy, including the side effects of each regimen. patient: Okay. doctor: We'll also obtain the rest of your paternal family history when your mother visits this weekend. The tumor is being tested for microsatellite instability, and we'll discuss this when those results are available. Your sibling is up-to-date on colonoscopy, which is good. patient: Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly. doctor: You're welcome. I'll check with Dr. Y's office to see if they have assessed your CEA and liver-associated enzymes. If not, we can draw those tomorrow. patient: Okay. doctor: I'll also order a prescription for pain medication to help manage any discomfort you may have. patient: Thank you. doctor: You're welcome. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask. patient: I will. Thank you again, Dr. doctor. doctor: You're welcome, Mrs. patient.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT New diagnosis of colon cancer.

I'm also aware that you met with Dr. X, the electrophysiologist, at General Hospital, and had a negative EP study. patient: Yes, that's correct. doctor: Now, I'd like to discuss the options for treating your atrial flutter. One option is to continue with atrial flutter and consider electrophysiologic consultation for ablation or heart rate control with anticoagulation. Another option is to proceed with cardioversion, which has a higher chance of restoring normal sinus rhythm with fewer long-term side effects. However, there are some risks associated with cardioversion, including oversedation, aspiration pneumonia, induction of other arrhythmias, and a small risk of stroke. patient: I understand. What do you recommend? doctor: I think cardioversion is the best option for you at this time. It's more likely to restore normal sinus rhythm and has fewer long-term side effects. patient: Okay. I agree. Let's do it. doctor: Alright. We'll start by giving you some medication to sedate you. Then, we'll use a defibrillator to deliver an electrical shock to your heart. This should restore your heart to a normal rhythm. patient: Sounds good. doctor: I'll be back in a few minutes to start the procedure. After the procedure doctor: The cardioversion was successful. Your heart is now in a normal rhythm. We'll keep you here for a while to monitor you, and then you can go home. patient: Thank you, doctor. I feel much better. doctor: You're welcome. I'm glad I could help. doctor: I've also discussed your case with Dr. Y, your general cardiologist, and he agrees with our plan.

And how long have you been experiencing this hematuria? patient: I've had problems with it in the past, but this episode is new. It started yesterday and has gotten worse today. doctor: Okay. Are you experiencing any other symptoms, such as fever, abdominal pain, or nausea? patient: No, I don't have any of those symptoms. I'm still able to pass urine, but it's mostly blood. doctor: I understand. Do you have any pain or discomfort in your lower back or groin area? patient: No, my lower back pain hasn't changed, and I don't have any groin pain. doctor: That's good to hear. I'm also aware that you have prostate cancer with metastatic disease to your bladder and skeletal system. Is that correct? patient: Yes, that's right. I've already completed chemotherapy, and I'm currently receiving radiation therapy for pain relief. doctor: I see. And you're not currently enrolled in hospice care? patient: No, I'm not. We're focusing on comfort care measures for now. doctor: Okay. I've reviewed your test results, and it appears that you have significant anemia, with a hemoglobin of 7.7 and a hematocrit of 22.6. We also found a large amount of blood and protein in your urine, along with elevated alkaline phosphatase and low albumin levels. patient: What does that mean? doctor: It means that your body is not producing enough red blood cells, and you have inflammation and damage to your liver. The blood in your urine is likely due to the cancer spreading to your bladder. patient: I see. So, what can we do about it? doctor: Well, there are a few options. We could admit you to the hospital and perform urologic scopes or even surgery if necessary. We could also transfuse you with blood to improve your anemia. However, given the advanced stage of your cancer, we need to consider your wishes and what would make you most comfortable. patient: I don't want to stay in the hospital. I'd rather go home. doctor: That's understandable. We can transfuse you with blood here in the emergency room and send you home tonight. We can also prescribe you antibiotics and pain medication to manage your symptoms. patient: That sounds like a good plan. doctor: Okay.

This can cause pain and other problems. I'm also concerned about a possible labral tear. patient: What's a labral tear? doctor: The labrum is a ring of cartilage that lines the hip joint. A labral tear is a tear in this cartilage. It can also cause pain and other problems. patient: So, what do we do now? doctor: I'm going to recommend that we get MRI arthrograms of your bilateral hips to evaluate the anatomy and especially concentrating on the labrum in the right hip. We'll get that done as soon as possible. In the meantime, I want you to moderate your activities. Avoid any activities that cause you pain. patient: Okay, I'll do that. doctor: I'll also prescribe some pain medication to help you manage your pain. patient: Thank you. doctor: You're welcome.

"Patient: Hello, doctor. I'm here because I've been having pain in my left flank and difficulty urinating. Doctor: I see. Can you tell me more about the pain? Where exactly is it located? Patient: It's on my left side, just below my ribs. It started a few days ago and has been getting worse. It's a sharp, stabbing pain that comes and goes. Doctor: Have you had any other symptoms, like fever, chills, or nausea? Patient: No, just the pain and the difficulty urinating. Doctor: How long have you been having trouble urinating? Patient: For about a day now. I feel like I have to go all the time, but when I do, I can only pass a small amount of urine. Doctor: I see. Do you have any history of kidney problems? Patient: Yes, I was in a car accident a few years ago and I bruised my left kidney. Doctor: I see. Well, I'd like to do a few tests to see what's causing your pain and difficulty urinating. Patient: Sure. Doctor: Okay, I'm going to order a CT scan and a urinalysis. I'd also like to draw some blood. Patient: Okay. Doctor: In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you some pain medication to help with the pain. Patient: Thank you. Doctor: You're welcome. I'll be back in a little while to check on you. After the tests are completed, the doctor returns to the patient's room. Doctor: I have your test results back. The CT scan showed a focal ileus in your left upper quadrant, but no thickening, no obstruction, no free air, a normal appendix, and no kidney stones. Your urinalysis showed 3+ bacteria. Patient: What does that mean? Doctor: It means that you have a urinary tract infection (UTI). This is a common infection that can cause pain and difficulty urinating. Patient: How do I treat it? Doctor: I'm going to prescribe you antibiotics to treat the infection. You should start feeling better within a few days. Patient: Okay. Doctor: I'm also going to recommend that you follow up with your primary care doctor in a week to make sure the infection is gone. Patient: I will. Doctor: Good.

"Patient: Hello, doctor. I'm here today because I've been experiencing chest pain, coughing, and shortness of breath. I've also lost 30 pounds recently. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that you're not feeling well. Can you tell me more about your symptoms? Patient: The chest pain started about a month ago. It's a sharp, stabbing pain that gets worse when I cough or take a deep breath. The coughing has been productive, with blood-tinged sputum. I've also been feeling short of breath, especially when I'm walking or climbing stairs. Doctor: Have you had any other symptoms, such as fatigue, night sweats, or loss of appetite? Patient: Yes, I've been feeling very tired lately. I've also been sweating a lot at night, even when it's cold. And I've lost my appetite. I just don't feel like eating. Doctor: I see. Well, I'd like to order a CT scan of your chest to get a better look at what's going on. Patient: Okay. Doctor: The CT scan showed that you have bilateral hilar adenopathy with extension to the subcarinal space, as well as a large 6-cm right hilar mass. This is consistent with a primary lung carcinoma. There was also a question of liver metastases at that time. Patient: What does that mean? Doctor: It means that you have cancer of the lung. The cancer has spread to the lymph nodes in your chest and may have also spread to your liver. Patient: Oh no. Doctor: I know this is a lot to take in. I'm going to recommend that we do a bronchoscopy to get a biopsy of the tumor. This will help us confirm the diagnosis and determine the best course of treatment. Patient: Okay. I'll do whatever it takes. Doctor: I'm glad to hear that. I'll schedule the bronchoscopy for tomorrow morning. Patient: Thank you, doctor. Doctor: You're welcome. I'll see you tomorrow.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Chest pain, cough, shortness of breath, weight loss. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a pleasant age-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of chest pain, cough, and shortness of breath. He reports the onset of sharp, stabbing chest pain approximately 1 month ago, which is exacerbated by coughing and deep inspiration. He also notes productive cough with blood-tinged sputum, as well as shortness of breath, particularly with exertion.

"doctor: Hello patient, how are you doing today? patient: I'm not doing too well, doctor. I've been having these episodes where my face feels like it's going to twitch. I can usually suppress it by grimacing, but it's still really annoying. doctor: I see. And how often do these episodes happen? patient: It used to be several times a day, but now it's down to maybe once a week. doctor: That's good to hear. It sounds like it's improving. patient: Yeah, a little bit. But I'm still having this weird pressure-like sensation in the right side of my head. It feels like tingling, and sometimes it feels like water is running down my hair. doctor: Interesting. And how often does that happen? patient: It's also decreased in frequency. It used to be every day, but now it's about once a week. And it usually goes away if I take some Aleve. doctor: Okay, that's helpful to know. Now, I understand you're also having some problems with sleepiness and fatigue. Can you tell me more about that? patient: Yes, I'm always tired. I have trouble falling asleep at night, even though I work from 4 pm to midnight. When I finally do fall asleep, I wake up by 9 am and can't get back to sleep. I usually only get about five or six hours of sleep a night. doctor: I see. And do you have any other symptoms, like snoring or gasping for breath at night? patient: I think I might snore, but I'm not sure. I don't remember waking up gasping for breath. doctor: Okay. Well, I've reviewed your medical history and your recent MRI results. The MRI showed a small abnormality in your right clivus and petrous carotid canal, but it's not clear what it is. It's unlikely to be related to your facial twitching or your headache. patient: That's a relief. doctor: I think the best course of action for now is to continue observing your symptoms. We can repeat the MRI in four months to see if there's any change. In the meantime, let's focus on addressing your sleep problems. patient: Okay. What can I do about that? doctor: Well, first, we need to try to get you on a more regular sleep schedule. Try going to bed later, at least 10 pm or 10:30 pm, so that you can get a full night's sleep. We can also talk about weight loss and exercise, which can also help improve sleep quality. patient: I'll try that. doctor: Great. I'm also going to recommend a sleep study to rule out obstructive sleep apnea. patient: Okay. doctor: We'll follow up in five months to see how you're doing. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen or you have any new concerns, please don't hesitate to call my office. patient: Thank you, doctor.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a pleasant age-year-old male who presents today for evaluation of facial twitching and headache. The patient reports that he has been experiencing episodes of facial twitching for several months. Initially, the episodes occurred several times a day, but they have now decreased to about once a week. He is able to suppress the twitching by grimacing. The patient also reports a pressure-like sensation in the right side of his head that feels like tingling or water running down his hair. This sensation used to occur daily, but it has also decreased in frequency to about once a week. The patient reports that the sensation usually goes away if he takes Aleve. The patient also reports sleepiness and fatigue. He works from 4 pm to midnight, and he has trouble falling asleep at night. He is able to fall asleep eventually, but he wakes up by 9 am and cannot get back to sleep. He usually only gets about five or six hours of sleep a night. The patient thinks he might snore, but he is not sure. He denies waking up gasping for breath at night. The patient's medical history is significant for an MRI that showed a small abnormality in his right clivus and petrous carotid canal.

They're different from the ones he used to have. doctor: In what way? patient: (mother speaks) They're more like tonic spells. He stiffens up and his eyes roll back. He also cries and vomits after some of them. doctor: How often are these seizures happening? patient: (mother speaks) At least multiple times a week. Sometimes he has none for a few days, but then he'll have multiple days in a row with seizures. doctor: I see. And what about his other seizures? The ones he used to have? patient: (mother speaks) He hasn't had any of those in a while. doctor: That's good to hear. Now, I'm going to need to do a physical exam. Is that okay with you? patient: (nods) doctor: (performs physical exam) doctor: Everything looks good. I'm going to admit you to the hospital for a few days so we can do a video EEG.

He could be discharged sooner if we capture multiple events. patient: (mother speaks) Okay. doctor: We'll also need to adjust his medications. We'll continue his current dose of Zonegran and Lamictal for now.

"Patient: Hello, doctor. I'm here today because I've been experiencing low back pain for several months now. It's a deep aching pain, primarily on the right lower back and gluteal region. Doctor: I see. And when did this pain start? Patient: It started in June 2008, after I fell on my tailbone and low back region. I had another fall in March 2006, when I lost my footing while qualifying on the range with a handgun. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Have you tried any treatments for the pain? Patient: Yes, I've had a cauterization of some sort to the nerves in my low back in October and November 2008. But it didn't help much. Doctor: Okay. I'd like to examine you now. (The doctor performs a physical examination.) Doctor: Your range of motion is limited in your lumbar spine. You also have mild tenderness on the right side of your back. And your strength is 4/5. Patient: I see. Doctor: Based on your symptoms and examination findings, I believe you have low back pain and degenerative lumbar disk disease. Patient: What does that mean? Doctor: It means that the disks in your lower back have degenerated, which is causing pain and inflammation. Patient: Is there anything I can do to treat it? Doctor: Yes, there are a few things we can try. First, I'm going to prescribe some physical therapy. This will help to strengthen your back muscles and improve your range of motion. I'm also going to prescribe some pain medication to help manage your pain. Patient: Okay. I'll do whatever it takes to get better.

"Patient: Doctor, I've been experiencing chest pain, coughing, and shortness of breath for the past few weeks. I've also noticed some blood in my sputum and have lost about 30 pounds recently. Doctor: I see. Those are concerning symptoms. Let's take a closer look at what might be causing them. Can you tell me more about your chest pain? Where exactly do you feel it, and how often does it occur? Patient: The pain is mostly in the center of my chest, and it comes and goes. It's not always there, but when it is, it can be pretty severe. Doctor: Okay, and what about the cough? Is it productive, meaning do you cough up any mucus or phlegm? Patient: Yes, I do. It's usually clear or white, but sometimes it's tinged with blood. Doctor: That's important information. Coughing up blood, or hemoptysis, can be a sign of a serious underlying condition. I'd like to order a chest CT scan to get a better look at your lungs. Patient: Sure, I'll do whatever it takes to figure out what's going on. Doctor: Good. I'll also arrange for a fiberoptic bronchoscopy. This is a procedure where we insert a thin, flexible tube with a camera on the end into your lungs to get a closer look at the airways and take some biopsies if necessary. Patient: That sounds a bit scary, but I trust you. I'll do it. Doctor: I appreciate your trust. We'll do everything we can to help you. After the bronchoscopy Doctor: I have the results of your bronchoscopy. The biopsies we took showed that you have a large tumor in your right lung. It appears to be malignant, which means it's cancerous. Patient: (Visibly shaken) Oh no... Is it serious? Doctor: It's certainly concerning, but we caught it early. We'll need to do some more tests to determine the exact type of cancer and the best course of treatment. Patient: What are my options? Doctor: There are several treatment options available, depending on the type of cancer and its stage. We'll discuss them in more detail once we have more information. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe some medication to help manage your symptoms. Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:, Based on the findings of the bronchoscopy, I believe that the patient has a primary lung carcinoma. I have discussed the findings with the patient and his family and we have decided to proceed with a PET scan to further evaluate the extent of his disease. We will then discuss treatment options based on the results of the PET scan. SUBJECTIVE:, The patient is a 67-year-old gentleman who presents to the emergency room with chest pain, cough, hemoptysis, shortness of breath, and recent 30-pound weight loss. He has a history of smoking one pack of cigarettes per day for 40 years. He denies any history of asbestos exposure or other occupational hazards. He has no known drug allergies.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Chest pain, cough, hemoptysis, shortness of breath, and weight loss.

These are small, fleshy growths that can block airflow and cause congestion. I also see some swelling in your turbinates. These are the structures that help to warm and moisten the air that you breathe. patient: So, what does this all mean? doctor: Well, it means that you have chronic sinusitis and nasal polyps. This is a condition that can cause a lot of discomfort and can make it difficult to breathe. patient: Is there anything we can do to treat it? doctor: Yes, there are a few different treatment options. We can try medical management first, with nasal sprays or oral medications. If those don't work, we may need to consider surgery. patient: Surgery? doctor: Yes, surgery is an option if the medical management doesn't work. The surgery would involve removing the polyps and opening up the sinuses to allow for better drainage. patient: I'm not sure if I'm ready for surgery. doctor: That's understandable. It's a big decision. But I think it's important to weigh the risks and benefits of surgery. If you're not having success with medical management, then surgery may be the best option for you. patient: I'll think about it. doctor: Okay. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe some nasal sprays and oral medications to see if we can improve your symptoms. patient: Thank you. doctor: You're welcome.

Getting enough rest is important for your overall health and well-being. patient: Yes, I know. I've been trying to get more sleep, but it's been difficult. doctor: Well, let's talk about your blood sugar levels. You mentioned that you've been testing your ketones first thing in the morning when you get home from work. What have your readings been like? patient: They've been varying. My fasting blood sugars have been between 77 and 87, my two-hour postprandial breakfast readings have been between 97 and 116, my pre-lunch readings have been between 77 and 108, my two-hour postprandial lunch readings have been between 86 and 131, my pre-supper readings have been between 78 and 100, and my two-hour postprandial supper readings have been between 121 and 161. My bedtime readings have been between 88 and 104. doctor: Okay, I've reviewed your blood sugar records and it seems like they're fluctuating quite a bit. This is likely due to your irregular eating patterns. patient: Yes, I know. I've been trying to eat more regularly, but it's been difficult with my work schedule and taking care of my children. doctor: I understand. That's why I'd like to provide you with some dietary guidelines that can help you manage your blood sugar levels and improve your overall health. patient: Okay. doctor: First, let's talk about your calorie needs. Your basal energy expenditure, which is the number of calories you need to maintain your current weight, is estimated at 1336 calories per day. However, since you're pregnant, you need additional calories to support the growth and development of your baby. Your total calorie requirements, including a physical activity factor, are approximately 2036 calories per day. patient: Wow, that's a lot of calories! doctor: I know it seems like a lot, but it's important to eat enough to maintain a healthy weight and support your pregnancy. patient: Okay. doctor: Now, let's talk about carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are the food source that contributes to the blood glucose response. We need to identify carbohydrate sources in the food supply and recognize that they are all good for you. The only carbohydrates you need to avoid are the concentrated forms of refined sugars. patient: Got it. doctor: In terms of your traditional food of rice, we can measure out a one-third cup serving to identify a 15-gram equivalent. It's important to moderate the portion of carbohydrates you consume at one time. Aim to eat every two to four hours over the course of the day when you're awake. patient: Okay, I'll try. doctor: I've also provided you with a sample 2000-calorie meal plan that has a carbohydrate content that represents 40% of the total calories. The meal plan is designed to distribute your carbohydrates more evenly throughout the day. You can use this as a guide, but feel free to adjust it based on your appetite and preferences. patient: Thank you. doctor: You're welcome. I also recommend that you include a solid protein with each of your meals and snacks, especially the snack before you go to sleep. Adequate rest is also important, so try to get at least 7-8 hours of sleep per night. patient: I'll do my best. doctor: Great.

"doctor: Good morning, Ms. Abc. Thank you for coming in today. I understand you're here for a consultation regarding your renal function. patient: Yes, that's right. I've been having some issues with my kidneys lately. doctor: I see. Can you tell me a little bit more about what you've been experiencing? patient: Well, I was recently admitted to XYZ Hospital for chest pain. They did some tests and found that my creatinine level was elevated at 2.4. They transferred me to University of A for further evaluation, and the cardiac catheterization there showed no signs of coronary artery disease. They also found that I had a urinary tract infection, which they treated with ciprofloxacin. My creatinine level remained elevated at 2.4 at both hospitals. doctor: I see. And since then, have you had any other symptoms? patient: Yes, I've been having a lot of urinary tract infections lately, even though I don't have any symptoms. I went to the emergency room about four months ago for one of these infections. I also have frequent urination, but no dysuria, urgency, or hematuria. doctor: Okay. Do you recall ever being told that you had kidney stones? patient: I think so, but I don't remember having any symptoms that would suggest that. doctor: And do you take any over-the-counter medications or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs? patient: No, I don't take any of those. I do have chronic hypokalemia and have been taking potassium supplements, but I'm not sure of the dose. doctor: I see. Well, Ms. Abc, based on your symptoms and medical history, I'd like to order some additional tests to get a better understanding of what's going on. patient: Sure, whatever you think is best. doctor: I'd like to do a repeat creatinine test, as well as a urinalysis and a urine culture. I'd also like to do a blood test to check your potassium levels. patient: Okay. doctor: I'll also refer you to a nephrologist for further evaluation and management. patient: Thank you, doctor. doctor: You're welcome. I'll have my nurse schedule your tests and appointment with the nephrologist. patient: Thank you again.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Evaluation of renal function. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a pleasant age-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of renal function. The patient reports a history of elevated creatinine at 2.4 mg/dL, which was discovered during an admission for chest pain at XYZ Hospital. The patient was subsequently transferred to University of A for further evaluation. A cardiac catheterization performed at University of A revealed no signs of coronary artery disease. A urinary tract infection was also diagnosed during the patient's hospitalization and treated with ciprofloxacin. The patient's creatinine level remained elevated at 2.4 mg/dL at both hospitals. The patient also reports a history of frequent urinary tract infections, although she denies any symptoms. She presented to the emergency room approximately 4 months ago for one of these infections. She also reports frequent urination, but denies dysuria, urgency, or hematuria. The patient is unsure if she has ever been diagnosed with kidney stones. She denies taking any over-the-counter medications or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. She does report a history of chronic hypokalemia and has been taking potassium supplements, but she is unsure of the dose. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. Elevated Creatinine and Urinary Tract Infection Assessment: Patient has a history of elevated creatinine and recurrent urinary tract infection.

"Doctor: Good morning, Mrs. Patient, thank you for coming in today. I understand you've been experiencing some pain and numbness in your limbs. Can you tell me a little bit more about that? Patient: Sure. It all started about a year and a half ago with pain in my left shoulder and neck. That eventually went away, but then in March of this year, I suddenly lost feeling in my right foot. I went to my primary care doctor, and they did a nerve conduction study and diagnosed me with radiculopathy. They also did an MRI of my lumbosacral spine, but it came back normal. Doctor: I see. And since then, have your symptoms progressed? Patient: Yes, they have. I've started to experience tingling sensations in my right middle toe, and then it spread to my knees, elbows, and left middle toe. More recently, I've been getting sensory sensations in my left hand and arm. I also feel a little wobbly on my knees and I'm dragging my left leg slightly. Doctor: Okay, and have you noticed anything that triggers these symptoms or makes them worse? Patient: Not really. The only thing I can think of is the vigorous workouts I started doing in November 2005. I've stopped exercising now, though, on the advice of my doctor. Doctor: I see. Well, I've reviewed your MRI results, and they show a large central disc herniation at C6-C7 with evidence of mild cord compression and abnormal signal in the cord suggesting cord edema. There's also a fairly large disc at C3-C4 with cord deformity and partial effacement of the subarachnoid space. Patient: What does that mean? Doctor: It means that you have cervical spondylosis, which is a condition where the discs in your neck become herniated and press on the spinal cord. This can cause a variety of symptoms, including pain, numbness, and weakness. Patient: Oh, I see. So what can be done about it? Doctor: Well, there are a few options. One is surgery to remove the herniated discs. Another is physical therapy to help strengthen the muscles in your neck and improve your range of motion. We can also try medication to relieve your pain and inflammation. Patient: I'm not sure about surgery. I'm a little hesitant to go through with that. Doctor: I understand. Surgery is a major decision, and it's important to weigh the risks and benefits carefully. But I do think it's important for you to follow up with a surgeon as soon as possible to discuss your options. Patient: Okay, I'll do that. Doctor: In the meantime, I'm going to recommend that you wear a hard collar while driving. This will help to support your neck and prevent further injury. Patient: Okay, I'll do that. Doctor: I'm also going to prescribe some medication to help relieve your pain and inflammation. Patient: Thank you. Doctor: You're welcome. I'm here if you have any other questions.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Pain and numbness in limbs.
