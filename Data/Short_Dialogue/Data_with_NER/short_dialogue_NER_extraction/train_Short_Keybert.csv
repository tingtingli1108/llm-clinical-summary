Doctor: No, he'll need to stay off it for a while, we call this nonweightbearing. It will only be for some time after the procedure, it's not permanent. Guest_family: What are the rest of the risks? Doctor: The total risks of surgery include risks of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, need for other surgical procedures, need to be nonweightbearing for some time.

GENHX,"Ms. XYZ is an otherwise fairly healthy 44-year-old right-handed aircraft mechanic. On her date of injury, she reports that she was working on an aircraft when she fell between the airplane and a stand with about an 18-inch gap in between. She injured her left knee and underwent two arthroscopic procedures followed by patellar replacement and subsequently a left total knee arthroplasty in Month DD, YYYY. The patient is seen with no outside images, but an MRI report of the left knee and office notes from Dr. ABCD. The patient reports that she has undergone a full course of physical therapy and complains primarily of pain in the anterior aspect of the left knee and primarily over the medial and lateral tibial components with pain extending proximally to the distal femur and distally down into the anterior tibial plateau area. She has intermittent numbness and tingling in the posterolateral thigh and no symptoms at all into her feet. She has axial low back pain as an ancillary symptom. Her pain is worse with walking and is associated with swelling, popping and grinding. She complains of pins and needles sensation over the area of the common peroneal nerve overlying the fibular head. She has no dysesthetic or allodynic symptoms with light touch over the remainder of the knee and the femoral nerve area. Heavy pressure and light percussion of the fibular head produce painful numbness, tingling, and pins and needles sensation. The patient underwent a left knee MRI in September of 2006 revealing nonspecific edema anterior to the patellar tendon, but no evidence of an acute fracture or a femoropatellar ligament avulsion or abnormality. She has continued to complain of persistent instability and pain. She is not working. She has a number of allergies to different pain medications and feels that her back has been bothersome mostly due to her gait disturbances relating to her knee. Her pain is described as constant, shooting, cramping, aching, throbbing, pulling, sharp, and stabbing in nature. It occasionally awakens her at night. It is better in recumbency with her leg elevated. Exacerbating factors include standing, walking, pushing, puling. VAS pain scale is rated as 6/10 for her average and current pain, 10/10 for worst pain, and 3/10 for her least pain.","Doctor: Good morning, Miss X Y Z, correct?

Patient: Yes I did, I had two arthroscopies, and an, um, patellar replacement after those. Doctor: Okay, yes, I see. Patient: Then, I had a left knee replacement on Month D D, Y Y Y Y. Doctor: Do you have any imaging of this knee? Patient: I didn't have any x rays done, but I have an MRI report and notes from Doctor A B C D. Doctor: Can I see that report? Patient: Yes absolutely, here. Doctor: Okay, so this M R I from September two thousand six shows some nonspecific edema anterior to the patellar tendon, but thankfully there's no evidence of fracture of ligamentous avulsion or abnormality. Patient: What does that mean? Doctor: There's some bleeding in the bone there, but nothing is broken or out of alignment. Patient: Oh, thank you, that's good. Doctor: Oh certainly, yes, it is. What treatments have you had for this knee, aside from surgery? Patient: I've done a full course of PT for this. Doctor: Where is your knee pain? Patient: Mostly, it's here in the front of the knee, and then on both sides, like the inside and outside. Doctor: Does the pain go down your leg at all? Patient: Yes, it goes down my, is this the femur? Doctor: Yes, that's the femur. Patient: Then this must be my tibia, it goes down the front of that too. Doctor: Does it go into your thigh at all? Patient: Yes, it goes into the back of my thigh. I feel numbness and tingling back there. Doctor: Do you feel anything in the feet? Patient: Nope, my feet are completely normal, thankfully. Doctor: Are you having any back pain? Patient: A little, I feel something in my lower back, I'm not sure if it's related. Doctor: Does anything make your knee pain worse? Patient: Yeah, I can hardly walk anymore, it hurts so bad. Doctor: What kind of symptoms do you see when you walk on this? Patient: I feel popping and grinding, and my knee swells up. Doctor: That numbness and tingling you feel in the thigh, do you feel that in the knee at all? Patient: Actually yes, it feels like pins and needles there. Doctor: What about this, when I touch the knee do you feel any abnormal discomfort or pain over the rest of the knee? Patient: No, nothing out of the ordinary there. Doctor: What about this, this is the fibular head, which is where you feel the pins and needles. I'm applying pretty heavy pressure here, how would you describe what you're feeling? Patient: Um, numbness, tingling, and then that same pins and needles feeling. Doctor: Is there any instability? Patient: Yes, and there's pain with it too. Doctor: Are you working right now? Patient: No, I'm not right now. Doctor: Any allergies I should know about? Patient: Yes, actually, I'm allergic to a lot of pain medications. Doctor: Okay, have there been any changes in how you're walking? Patient: Yes, I had to change my walking pattern to take weight off my knee, and I think that has to do with my back pain. Doctor: That's certainly a possibility. How would you describe your pain?

She stated may be she needed to be, meaning taking some medications. The patient had been prescribed Wellbutrin in the past and responded well to it; however, at that time it was prescribed for obsessive-compulsive type disorder relating to overeating and therefore her insurance would not cover the medication. She has not been on any other antidepressants in the past. She is not having any suicidal ideation but is having difficulty concentrating, rapid mood swings with tearfulness, and insomnia. She denies any hot flashes or night sweats. She underwent TAH with BSO in December of 2003.","Patient: I think I need help. Doctor: I am here to help. Tell me what's going on.

GENHX,"This patient presents to the office today for a checkup. He has several things to go over and discuss. First he is sick. He has been sick for a month intermittently, but over the last couple of weeks it is worse. He is having a lot of yellow phlegm when he coughs. It feels likes it is in his chest. He has been taking Allegra-D intermittently, but he is almost out and he needs a refill. The second problem, his foot continues to breakout. It seems like it was getting a lot better and now it is bad again. He was diagnosed with tinea pedis previously, but he is about out of the Nizoral cream. I see that he is starting to breakout again now that the weather is warmer and I think that is probably not a coincidence. He works in the flint and it is really hot where he works and it has been quite humid lately. The third problem is that he has a wart or a spot that he thinks is a wart on the right middle finger. He is interested in getting that frozen today. Apparently, he tells me I froze a previous wart on him in the past and it went away. Next, he is interested in getting some blood test done. He specifically mentions the blood test for his prostate, which I informed him is called the PSA. He is 50 years old now. He will also be getting his cholesterol checked again because he has a history of high cholesterol. He made a big difference in his cholesterol by quitting smoking, but unfortunately after taking his social history today he tells me that he is back to smoking. He says it is difficult to quit. He tells me he did quit chewing tobacco. I told him to keep trying to quit smoking.","Doctor: How are you doing today, sir? Patient: Honestly, I'm pretty sick today. I've got a lot going on.

I'm concerned. I am fifty after all. Doctor: Sure, we can check your cholesterol too. I know you have history of it being high. Patient: You know, I've been working on that.

GENHX,"The patient initially presented with loud obnoxious snoring that disrupted the sleep of his bed partner. He was found to have moderate-to-severe sleep apnea (predominantly hypopnea), was treated with nasal CPAP at 10 cm H2O nasal pressure. He has been on CPAP now for several months, and returns for followup to review his response to treatment. The patient reports that the CPAP has limited his snoring at night. Occasionally, his bed partner wakes him in the middle of the night, when the mask comes off, and reminds him to replace the mask. The patient estimates that he uses the CPAP approximately 5 to 7 nights per week, and on occasion takes it off and does not replace the mask when he awakens spontaneously in the middle of the night. The patient's sleep pattern consists of going to bed between 11:00 and 11:30 at night and awakening between 6 to 7 a.m. on weekdays. On weekends, he might sleep until 8 to 9 a.m. On Saturday night, he might go to bed approximately mid night. As noted, the patient is not snoring on CPAP.

Doctor: Yes, I see on your chart that you were given ten centimeters of H two O nasal pressure and that you predominately suffer from hypopnea. Hypopnea is shallow breathing. How has the device been working? Patient: It definitely has reduced my snoring, but my partner keeps waking me up in the middle of the night because the mask pops off. I wear it around five to seven nights a week, but for some reason it falls off or I take it off randomly in the night. My wife usually must remind me to put it back on. Doctor: So what is your sleep pattern now? When do you usually go to bed and wake up? Patient: Usually I sleep around eleven or eleven thirty and wake up at six or seven on the weekends. I'll sleep in until eight or nine on the weekdays. On Saturday's I might go to sleep around midnight because I usually watch a show with my family. I feel good when I wake up though.

Around fifteen to eighteen pounds is something to be proud of. Patient: Thanks. It has been a lot of exercising and dieting. I am motivated because I want to stop snoring. Doctor: How has work been? Do you think it has been stressful at all? Patient: I still work at Smith Barney in downtown Baltimore. I work from around eight or eight thirty to five or five thirty. I deal with training on how to sell managed funds and accounts. I do not think I have been stressed because I am able to stay awake through my shift and even when I come home at night.

Lately it is staying bigger and she somewhat uncomfortable with it being so large. The right leg also swells, but not nearly like the left leg. The other problem she had was she has had pain in her shoulder and back. These occurred about a year ago, but the pain in her left shoulder is of most concern to her. She feels like the low back pain is just a result of a poor mattress. She does not remember hurting her shoulder, but she said gradually she has lost some mobility. It is hard time to get her hands behind her back or behind her head. She has lost strength in the left shoulder. As far as the blood count goes, she had an elevated white count.

GENHX,"This is a pleasant 49-year-old gentleman post lumbar disc replacement from January 2005. Unfortunately, the surgery and interventional procedures have not been helpful in alleviating his pain. He has also tried acupuncture, TENS unit, physical therapy, chiropractic treatment and multiple neuropathic medications including Elavil, Topamax, Cymbalta, Neurontin, and Lexapro, which he discontinued either due to side effects or lack of effectiveness in decreasing his pain. Most recently, he has had piriformis injections, which did give him a brief period of relief; however, he reports that the Botox procedure that was done on March 8, 2006 has not given him any relief from his buttock pain. He states that approximately 75% of his pain is in his buttock and leg and 25% in his back. He has tried to increase in his activity with walking and does note increased spasm with greater activity in the low back. He rated his pain today as 6/10, describing it is shooting, sharp and aching. It is increased with lifting, prolonged standing or walking and squatting, decreased with ice, reclining and pain medication. It is constant but variable in degree. It continues to affect activities and sleep at night as well as mood at times. He is currently not satisfied completely with his level of pain relief.","Doctor: Good afternoon, sir.

I know they said that they removed something, but I'm not sure, but after that it has been improved a lot. Doctor: Okay, let me see in my chart. You had some rectal bleeding issues because of which I referred you to the gastroenterologist. A complete endoscopy was performed, which was both on the upper and the lower side. There was no evidence of ulcers or any other abnormality. That's good news, right? Patient: Yeah, I agree. That was a relief. Doctor: They did find some polyps and they removed it. They turned out to be benign, so nothing to worry about there. Patient: Yeah, I remember this said they removed something, but I forgot the name.

GENHX,"The patient is a 55-year-old gentleman who presents for further evaluation of right leg weakness. He has difficulty recollecting the exact details and chronology of his problem. To the best of his recollection, he thinks that about six months ago he developed weakness of his right leg. He describes that he is reaching to get something from a cabinet and he noticed that he was unable to stand on his right toe. Since that time, he has had difficulty pushing off when he walks. He has mild tingling and numbness in his toes, but this has been a chronic problem and nothing new since he has developed the weakness. He has chronic mild back pain, but this has been persistent for many years and has not changed. He has experienced cramps in both calves for the past year. This dissipated about two months ago. He does not think that his left leg is weak. He does not have any bowel or bladder incontinence. There is no radicular pain. He does not think that the problem is progressive, meaning that the weakness that he perceives in his right leg is no different than when it was six months ago. He first sought medical attention for this problem in October. He then saw you a couple of months later. He has undergone an EMG and nerve conduction studies. Unfortunately, he cannot undergo an MRI of his spine because he has an ear implant. He has had a CT scan that shows degenerative changes, but nothing obviously abnormal. In addition, the patient has hyperCKemia. He tells me that he has had an elevated CK prior to starting taking stat medications, although this is not entirely clear to me. He thinks that he is not taking Lipitor for about 15 months and thought that his CK was in the 500 or 600s prior to starting it. Once it was started, it increased to about 800 and then came down to about 500 when it was stopped. He then had a recent bump again up to the 1000 and since Lipitor has been stopped, his CK apparently has returned to about the 500 or 600s. I do no have any laboratory data to support these statements by the patient, but he seems to be up to speed on this. More recently, he has been started taking Zetia. He does not have any proximal weakness. He denies any myalgias.","Doctor: Hi there! I am Doctor Jones, sir. Patient: Hello! It is nice to meet you. Doctor: What brings you into see me today? Patient: I have had this weakness in my right leg for quite some time now. Doctor: How long has this been going on and do you know how you injured yourself?

Patient: I was reaching to get something from a cabinet, and I noticed that I was unable to stand on my right toe. Ever since then I have had difficulty pushing off when walking. My toes were tingling and numb. Doctor: Was the numbness and tingling mild, moderate, or severe? Patient: It was a mild feeling, but this has been an ongoing problem that has been the same since the weakness started. Doctor: Have you had any other pain any where else in your body? Patient: I have had back pain, but this has been going on for many years and has not changed. Doctor: Is the back pain been mild, moderate, or severe? Patient: I would say mild. I have also been having cramping in both calves. Doctor: How long has that been going on? Patient: For the past year but it stopped about two months ago. Doctor: Have you had any weakness in the left leg? Patient: No. I don't think so. Doctor: Have you had any pain around right leg and the area of numbness and tingling? Patient: No. Everything that is going on with my right leg has pretty much been the same since it started six months ago. I have not gotten worse or better. Doctor: Have you had any bowel or bladder incontinence? Any radicular pain? Patient: No. Doctor: When did you first see a doctor for the issue? I remember that you told me you saw a different provider prior to coming to see me. Patient: I saw the other doctor in October. That was a couple of months before I came to see you. Doctor: I see in your chart that we did a CT scan that shows degenerative changes, but nothing obviously abnormal. Remind me why we did not do a MRI of your spine? Patient: I cannot have an MRI because of my ear implant. Doctor: That is unfortunate. It looks like we were able to do an EMG and nerve conduction studies. What medications are you taking currently? Patient: I had an elevated CK before I started taking stat medications. Doctor: What medications are those? Patient: I am not taking Lipitor anymore. I think I took it for about fifteen months. Doctor: Do you know what your levels of your CK were before you started taking medication? Patient: I thought that my CK was in the five hundred or six hundreds prior to starting it. Once I started it, my levels increased to about eight hundred and then came down to about five hundred again when it was stopped. I recently stopped taking Lipitor because my levels were up to the thousand's and then my CK apparently has returned to about the five hundreds or six hundreds.

Her difficulties were first noted by family the week prior to Thanksgiving, when they were taking her to Vail, Colorado to play ""Murder She Wrote"" at family gathering. Unbeknownst to the patient was the fact that she had been chosen to be the ""assassin."" Prior to boarding the airplane her children hid a toy gun in her carry-on luggage. As the patient walked through security the alarm went off and within seconds she was surrounded, searched and interrogated. She and her family eventually made their flight, but she seemed unusually flustered and disoriented by the event. In prior times they would have expected her to have brushed off the incident with a ""chuckle."" While in Colorado her mentation seemed slow and she had difficulty reading the lines to her part while playing ""Murder She Wrote."" She needed assistance to complete the game. The family noted no slurring of speech, difficulty with vision, or focal weakness at the time. She returned to work at a local florist shop the Monday following Thanksgiving, and by her own report, had difficulty carrying out her usual tasks of flower arranging and operating the cash register. She quit working the next day and never went back. Her mental status appeared to remain relatively stable throughout the month of November and December and during that time she was evaluated by a local neurologist. Serum VDRL, TFTs, GS, B12, Folate, CBC, CXR, and MRI of the Brain were all reportedly unremarkable. The working diagnosis was ""Dementia of the Alzheimer's Type."" One to two weeks prior to her 1/12/95 presentation, she became repeatedly lost in her own home. In addition, she, and especially her family, noticed increased difficulty with word finding, attention, and calculation. Furthermore, she began expressing emotional lability unusual for her. She also tended to veer toward the right when walking and often did not recognize the location of people talking to her.","Doctor: How old are you? Patient: I am seventy three.

Doctor: Okay. Guest_family: Kids played a trick with her and they hid a plastic gun, a toy gun in her luggage. As she walked through the security, the alarm went off and like within seconds she was all surrounded, and everyone was like panicked.

This time it was different. Doctor: I can see why she was frustrated. Anyone can be in such situations. Guest_family: When we were in Colorado, she seemed slow. She had difficulty reading her lines to her part when we were playing that game. She needed assistance to complete the whole game. Doctor: Was she slurring? Guest_family: Nope. Doctor: Was there any difficulty with vision? Or any weakness? Guest_family: Nope. Nothing that we noticed. Doctor: How was it after returning from there? Guest_family: She returned to work.

When did these symptoms increase? Like when did you started noticing them more? Guest_family: One or two weeks ago, so end of December nineteen ninety four, she got lost in her own home.

He states that since that time these symptoms have been progressive and now involving his legs above his knees as well as his hands. More recently, he describes a burning sensation along with numbness. This has become a particular problem and of all the problems he has he feels that pain is his primary concern.

GENHX,This 67 y/oRHM first began experiencing horizontal binocular diplopia 25 years prior to presentation in the Neurology Clinic. The diplopia began acutely and continued intermittently for one year. During this time he was twice evaluated for myasthenia gravis (details of evaluation not known) and was told he probably did not have this disease. He received no treatment and the diplopia spontaneously resolved. He did well until one year prior to presentation when he experienced sudden onset horizontal binocular diplopia. The diplopia continues to occur daily and intermittently; and lasts for only a few minutes in duration. It resolves when he covers one eye. It is worse when looking at distant objects and objects off to either side of midline. There are no other symptoms associated with the diplopia.,"Doctor: Hi there!

I reviewed the new patient questionnaire, which she completed prior to her arrival today. I also reviewed the results of tests, which she had brought with her. Briefly, she is a 60-year-old woman initially from Ukraine, who had headaches since age 25. She recalls that in 1996 when her husband died her headaches became more frequent. They were pulsating. She was given papaverine, which was successful in reducing the severity of her symptoms. After six months of taking papaverine, she no longer had any headaches. In 2004, her headaches returned. She also noted that she had ""zig-zag lines"" in her vision. Sometimes she would not see things in her peripheral visions. She had photophobia and dizziness, which was mostly lightheadedness. On one occasion she almost had a syncope. Again she has started taking Russian medications, which did help her. The dizziness and headaches have become more frequent and now occur on average once to twice per week. They last two hours since she takes papaverine, which stops the symptoms within 30 minutes.","Doctor: Nurse, did you get the documents from the patient? Guest_clinician: I did.

GENHX,"The patient is a 63-year-old left-handed gentleman who presents for further evaluation of multiple neurological symptoms. I asked him to discuss each symptom individually as he had a very hard time describing the nature of his problems. He first mentioned that he has neck pain. He states that he has had this for at least 15 years. It is worse with movement. It has progressed very slowly over the course of 15 years. It is localized to the base of his neck and is sharp in quality. He also endorses a history of gait instability. This has been present for a few years and has been slightly progressively worsening. He describes that he feels unsteady on his feet and ""walks like a duck."" He has fallen about three or four times over the past year and a half. He also describes that he has numbness in his feet. When I asked him to describe this in more detail, the numbness is actually restricted to his toes. Left is slightly more affected than the right. He denies any tingling or paresthesias. He also described that he is slowly losing control of his hands. He thinks that he is dropping objects due to weakness or incoordination in his hands. This has also been occurring for the past one to two years. He has noticed that buttoning his clothes is more difficult for him. He also does not have any numbness or tingling in the hands. He does have a history of chronic low back pain. At the end of the visit, when I asked him which symptom was most bothersome to him, he actually stated that his fatigue was most troublesome. He did not even mention this on the initial part of my history taking. When I asked him to describe this further, he states that he experiences a general exhaustion. He basically lays in bed all day everyday. I asked him if he was depressed, he states that he is treated for depression. He is unsure if this is optimally treated. As I just mentioned, he stays in bed almost all day long and does not engage in any social activities. He does not think that he is necessarily sad. His appetite is good. He has never undergone any psychotherapy for depression. When I took his history, I noticed that he is very slow in responding to my questions and also had a lot of difficulty recalling details of his history as well as names of physicians who he had seen in the past. I asked if he had ever been evaluated for cognitive difficulties and he states that he did undergo testing at Johns Hopkins a couple of years ago. He states that the results were normal and that specifically he did not have any dementia. When I asked him when he was first evaluated for his current symptoms, he states that he saw Dr. X several years ago. He believes that he was told that he had neuropathy but that it was unclear if it was due to his diabetes. He told me that more recently he was evaluated by you after Dr. Y referred him for this evaluation. He also saw Dr. Z for neurosurgical consultation a couple of weeks ago.

GENHX,"This is a 25-year-old woman who is attending psychology classes. She was diagnosed with presumptive erythema nodosum in 2004 based on a biopsy consistent with erythema nodosum, but not entirely specific back in Netherlands. At that point, she had undergone workup which was extensive for secondary diseases associated with erythema nodosum. Part of her workup included a colonoscopy. The findings were equivocal characterizes not clearly abnormal biopsies of the terminal ileum. The skin biopsy, in particular, mentions some fibrosis, basal proliferation, and inflammatory cells in the subcutis. Prior to the onset of her erythema nodosum, she had a tibia-fibula fracture several years before on the right, which was not temporarily associated with the skin lesions, which are present in both legs anyway. Even, a jaw cosmetic surgery she underwent was long before she started developing her skin lesions. She was seen in our clinic and by Dermatology on several occasions. Apart from the first couple of visits when she presented stating a recurrent skin rash with a description suggestive of erythema nodosum in the lower extremities and ankle and there is discomfort pointing towards a possible inflammatory arthritis and an initial high sed rate of above 110 with an increased CRP. In the following visits, no evident abnormality has been detected. In the first visit, here some MTP discomfort detected. It was thought that erythema nodosum may be present. However, the evaluation of Dermatology did not concur and it was thought that the patient had venous stasis, which could be related to her prior fracture. When she was initially seen here, a suspicion of IBD, sarcoid inflammatory arthropathy, and lupus was raised. She had an equivocal rheumatoid fracture, but her CCP was negative. She had an ANA, which was positive at 1:40 with a speckled pattern persistently, but the rest of the lupus serologies including double-stranded DNA, RNP, Smith, Ro, La were negative. Her cardiolipin panel antibodies were negative as well. We followed the IgM, IgG, and IgA being less than 10. However, she did have a beta-2 glycoprotein 1 or an RVVT tested and this may be important since she has a livedo pattern. It was thought that the onset of lupus may be the case. It was thought that rheumatoid arthritis could not be the case since it is not associated with erythema nodosum. For the fear of possible lymphoma, she underwent CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. It was done also in order to rule out sarcoid and the result was unremarkable. Based on some changes in her bowel habits and evidence of B12 deficiency with a high methylmalonic and high homocystine levels along with a low normal B12 in addition to iron studies consistent with iron deficiency and an initially low MCV, the possibility of inflammatory bowel disease was employed. The patient underwent an initially unrevealing colonoscopy and a capsule endoscopy, which was normal. A second colonoscopy was done recently and microscopically no evidence of inflammatory bowel disease was seen. However, eosinophil aggregations were noted in microscopy and this was told to be consistent with an allergic reaction or an emerging Crohn disease and I will need to discuss with Gastroenterology what is the significance of that. Her possible B12 deficiency and iron deficiency were never addressed during her stay here in the United States. In the initial appointment, she was placed on prednisone 40 mg, which was gradually titrated down this led to an exacerbation of her acne. We decided to take her off prednisone due to adverse effects and start her on colchicine 0.6 mg daily. While this kept things under control with the inflammatory markers being positive and no overt episodes of erythema nodosum, the patient still complains for sensitivity with less suspicious skin rash in the lower extremities and occasional ankle swelling and pain. She was reevaluated by Dermatology for that and no evidence of erythema nodosum was felt to be present. Out plan was to proceed with a DEXA scan, at some point check a vitamin D level, and order vitamin D and calcium over the counter for bone protection purposes. However, the later was deferred until we have resolved the situation and find out what is the underlying cause of her disease. Her past medical history apart from the tibia-fibular fracture and the jaw cosmetic surgery is significant for varicella and mononucleosis. Her physical examination had shown consistently diffuse periarticular ankle edema and also venous stasis changes at least until I took over her care last August. I have not been able to detect any erythema nodosum, however, a livedo pattern has been detected consistently. She also has evidence of acne, which does not seem to be present at the moment. She also was found to have a heart murmur present and we are going to proceed with an echocardiogram placed. Her workup during the initial appointment included an ACE level, which was normal. She also had a rather higher sed rate up to 30, but prior to that, per report, it was even higher, above 110. Her RVVT was normal, her rheumatoid factor was negative. Her ANA was 1:40, speckled pattern. The double-stranded DNA was negative. Her RNP and Smith were negative as well. RO and LA were negative and cardiolipin antibodies were negative as well. A urinalysis at the moment was completely normal. A CRP was 2.3 in the initial appointment, which was high. A CCP was negative. Her CBC had shown microcytosis and hypochromia with a hematocrit of 37.7. This improved later without any evidence of hypochromia, microcytosis or anemia with a hematocrit of 40.3. The patient returns here today, as I mentioned, complaining of milder bouts of skin rash, which she calls erythema nodosum, which is accompanied by arthralgias, especially in the ankles. I am mentioning here that photosensitivity rash was mentioned in the past. She tells me that she had it twice back in Europe after skiing where her whole face was swollen. Her acne has been very stable after she was taken off prednisone and was started on colchicine 0.6 daily. Today we discussed about the effect of colchicine on a possible pregnancy.","Doctor: Hello, miss. Doctor X and I will be going over your medical history with you. Before we begin, could you confirm your age for me? Patient: I'm twenty five years old. Doctor: Thank you. Doctor X, could you go over the diagnosis of erythema nodosum? Doctor_2: She was diagnosed in two thousand and four after a biopsy was done that confirmed erythema nodosum, but the detail from the Netherlands is not that specific. Doctor: What kind of procedures were done to address it? Doctor_2: She had undergone a colonoscopy to address secondary diseases that may have been present because of the erythema nodosum, correct miss? Patient: Yeah, that's correct. Doctor: Were there any findings, Doctor X? Doctor_2: The findings were uncertain if the terminal ileum had abnormal biopsies. However, the skin biopsy mentioned some fibrosis, basal proliferation, and inflammatory cells in the subcutis. Doctor: I see. Her report states something about a tibia and fibula fracture on her right leg before the erythema nodosum. Are these skin lesions due to the fracture? Doctor_2: The skin lesions are not associated with the fracture, correct ma'am? Patient: That's correct. The cuts in my skins are on both legs too. Not just the right. Doctor: Thank you. Did anything occur before the skin lesions? Doctor_2: She had cosmetic surgery done on her jaw. Doctor: Ma'am, I see you visited our clinic and the Dermatology several times, correct? Patient: Yeah, that's correct. I had a rash that I wanted to get checked. Doctor_2: I remember that. I was here when she presented the rash. We suggested the rash in her lower extremities and ankles was erythema nodosum. She also had discomfort, which could have been inflammatory arthritis. Doctor: Doctor X, did you confirm with any tests? Doctor_2: Yes. There was an initial S E D above one hundred and ten and her C P R was increased. Doctor: Great. In the visits after, were there any other problems found? Doctor_2: The reports says that no other abnormalities were found. However, I do see something about her first visit. Doctor: Could you explain what it says? Doctor_2: She has some M T P detected, which could have been signs of erythema nodosum. However, the Dermatology did not agree, and they believed it to be venous stasis. Doctor: The venous stasis could have been related to the fracture, right? Doctor_2: That is correct. Doctor: Her initial visit reports suspicion of I B D, sarcoid inflammatory arthropathy, and lupus. Why was that? Doctor_2: She had a questionable rheumatoid fracture even though her C C P was negative. Her A N A was positive at one to four zero. There was a persistent speckled pattern. However, the rest of the lupus serologies were negative. Doctor: What lupus serologies were used? Doctor_2: Double stranded D N A, R N P, Smith, R O, and L A were used. Doctor: How did her cardiolipin antibodies panel look? Doctor_2: They were all negative. We made sure I g M, I g G, and I g A were less than ten. Doctor: I see. Was there anything else in the report? Doctor_2: She had her beta 2 glycoprotein one or R V V T tested. Doctor: That seems important because of the livedo pattern. Doctor_2: Exactly. That's why they concluded it was an onset of lupus and not rheumatoid arthritis because the arthritis couldn't be associated with erythema nodosum. Doctor: Why did she undergo a C T scan? Doctor_2: We feared she had lymphoma. The scan of her chest, abdomen, and pelvis were done to rule out sarcoid. Doctor: I see. The results came out normal, right? Doctor_2: That's correct. Doctor: Did you change some of you habits to help your bowels, ma'am? Patient: I tried my best to. Doctor: That's good. What was found Doctor X? Doctor_2: There was evidence of B twelve deficiency with a high methylmalonic and high homocystine levels along with a low normal B twelve in addition to iron studies consistent with iron deficiency and an initially low M C V. Doctor: That gives the possibility of inflammatory bowel disease, right? Doctor_2: Correct. That's stated in the report. Doctor: Were there any tests done to confirm this? Doctor_2: She underwent a colonoscopy, which showed nothing. Her endoscopy was also normal. Recently, she underwent a second coloscopy, and no evidence of inflammatory bowel disease was seen after viewing it microscopically. Doctor: Nothing was seen microscopically? Doctor_2: Actually, we determined there were aggregates of eosinophils. Doctor: That sounds important. That could be due to an allergic reaction or an emergence of Crohn Disease. I will have to discuss with Doctor Y from Gastroenterology to see the significance. Patient: Could I interrupt for a second? I don't think my B twelve and iron deficiency were looked at while I stayed in the United States. Doctor: Is that correct, Doctor X? Doctor_2: That is. I think these details were from somewhere else. Doctor: At least we are aware of it. What medication was provided during her first visit? Doctor_2: It looks like she was placed on forty milligrams of prednisone. The strength was reduced over time. Doctor: This may be a reason to her acne. Was she taken off this medication? Doctor_2: Yes, she was. There were too many adverse effects. Doctor: What was she places on after? Doctor_2: It looks like she started a point six m g colchicine, which she took daily. Doctor: How were her inflammatory markers after taking it? Doctor_2: Her markers were under control and positive. She also didn't have any evidence of erythema nodosum. Doctor: That is great. How did you like that medication, ma'am? Patient: My ankle would swell up and hurt. There were also some sensitive rashes on the skin of my legs. Doctor: I see. Is that stated on the report, Doctor X? Doctor_2: It is. I also see that she was reevaluated by Dermatology. Doctor: Did they find anything apparent? Doctor_2: No, they didn't. They didn't find any evidence of erythema nodosum. Doctor: What was the plan following that? Docotr_2: It looks like we proceeded with a D E X A scan and checked her vitamin D levels. Doctor: Was there any medication prescribed? Doctor_2: We ordered vitamin D and calcium to be bought over the counter so that her bones were protected. However, they use of them was stopped until we figured out the underlying cause of her disease. Doctor: I see. Other than the fracture and jaw surgery, was there anything else? Doctor_2: It shows she had Varicella and Mononucleosis, correct ma'am? Patient: Yeah, that's correct. Doctor: That's good. Our recent physical exam with you from last August showed changes in your venous stasis and diffuse periarticular ankle edema. Fortunately, we did not find any erythema nodosum, but the livedo patter was still present. Patient: I see. Did you find anything else? Doctor: We did find a heart murmur, so we will conduct an echocardiogram. Doctor X, could you confirm all the details form the workup, please? Doctor_2: Of course. Her A C E levels were normal. Her sed rate was around 30, which was high. Before that, it was around one ten, which is even higher. Her R V V T was normal. The rheumatoid factor was negative. The urinalysis was also normal. She had a C R P level of two point three, which was high. Her C C P came out negative. Her C B C displayed microcytosis and hypochromia with hematocrit levels of thirty seven point seven. Her hematocrit levels improved to forty point three later on, and she did not have any hypochromia, microcytosis, or anemia present. Doctor: Thank you for all that information. Does all this information and history seem to be correct, ma'am? Patient: Yes. Thank you for going over that in front of me. Doctor: No problem. I see you're here today regarding some mild but intense skin rashes. You mentioned that you thought it was erythema nodosum, correct? Patient: Yeah, that's correct. I think it's on my ankles. I also feel some joint stiffness. Doctor: I will take note of that. You also mentioned something about a rash before. Did you have a rash that was sensitive to U V light, like sunlight? Patient: That's right. I had it twice when I was in Europe. Doctor: When did you notice the rashes? Patient: I was skiing, and my face started to swell up. Doctor: I see. Do you think it had to do anything with your acne? Patient: No. My acne was stable after I stopped taking that one medicine and started the other. Doctor: The prednisone and colchicine we mentioned earlier, correct? Patient: That's correct. Doctor: Is there anything else you would like to ask? Patient: I am trying to get pregnant and would like to know if the medication has any effects on pregnancy. Doctor: I'll discus that with you right now.

The patient's main job was loading and unloading furniture and appliances for the home. The patient was approximately there for about two and a half weeks. Date of injury occurred back in October. The patient stating that he had history of previous back problems ongoing; however, he states that on this particular day back in October, he was unloading an 18-wheeler at ABC and he was bending down picking up boxes to unload and load. Unfortunately at this particular event, the patient had sharp pain in his lower back. Soon afterwards, he had radiating symptoms down his right buttock all the way down to the lateral part of his leg crossing his knee. This became progressively worse. He also states that some of his radiating pain went down to his left leg as well. He noticed increase in buttock spasm and also noticed spasm in his buttocks. He initially saw Dr. Z and was provided with some muscle relaxer and was given some pain patches or Lidoderm patch, I believe. The patient states that after this treatment, his symptoms still persisted. At this point, the patient later on was referred to Dr. XYZ through the workmen's comp and he was initially evaluated back in April. After the evaluation, the patient was sent for MRI, was provided with pain medications such as short-acting opioids. He was put on restricted duty. The MRI essentially came back negative, but the patient continued to have radiating symptoms down to his lower extremity and subsequently the patient was essentially released by Dr. XYZ in June with maximum medical improvement. Unfortunately, the patient continued to have persistence of back pain and radiating symptoms down to his leg and went back to see Dr. XYZ again, and at this point, the patient was provided with further medication management and sent for Pain Clinic referral. The patient also was recommended for nerve block at this point and the patient received epidural steroid injection by Dr. ABC without any significant relief.

He was able to get up shortly after falling and according to the patient and his son, subsequently returned back to normal. He was then well until the 3rd of July 2008 when his legs again gave way on him. This was not preceded by lightheadedness. He was rushed to the hospital and was found to have pneumonia, and the fall was blamed on the pneumonia. He started using a walker from that time, prior to that he was able to walk approximately two miles per day. He again had a fall in August of 2008 after his legs gave way. Again, there was no lightheadedness associated with this. He was again found to have pneumonia and again was admitted to hospital after which he went to rehabilitation and was able to use his walker again after this.

GENHX,"The patient is a 45-year-old African-American female whose symptoms first started some one and a half years ago with pain in the left shoulder and some neck pain. This has subsequently resolved. She started vigorous workouts in November 2005. In March of this year, she suddenly could not feel her right foot on the bathroom floor and subsequently went to her primary care physician. By her report, she had a nerve conduction study and a diagnosis of radiculopathy was made. She had an MRI of lumbosacral spine, which was within normal limits. She then developed a tingling sensation in the right middle toe. Symptoms progressed to sensory symptoms of her knees, elbows, and left middle toe. She then started getting sensory sensations in the left hand and arm. She states that she feels a little bit wobbly at the knees and that she is slightly dragging her left leg. Symptoms have been mildly progressive. She is unaware of any trigger other than the vigorous workouts as mentioned above. She has no associated bowel or bladder symptoms. No particular position relieves her symptoms. Workup has included two MRIs of the C-spine, which were personally reviewed and are discussed. She saw you for consultation and the possibility of surgical decompression was raised. At this time, she is somewhat reluctant to go through any surgical procedure.","Doctor: Good afternoon, ma'am.
