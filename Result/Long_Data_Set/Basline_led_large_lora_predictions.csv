"doctor: Good morning, Mr. A. Thank you for coming in today. I understand you're here for a new patient evaluation. patient: That's right. doctor: Can you tell me a little bit about your medical history? patient: Well, I've had two surgeries in the past. The first was in July of 2006, and the second was in August of 2007. After that, I started having seizures and hemiparesis. I've been in and out of the hospital, and I developed C. diff. I'm currently in a nursing home because I'm unable to care for myself. doctor: I see. I've reviewed your medical records, including the information from the nursing home. It looks like you're taking Keppra, Decadron, oxycodone, aspirin, Prilosec, Dilantin, and Flagyl. Is that correct? patient: Yes, that's right. doctor: Okay. I've also reviewed your imaging studies. It shows that you have a malignant meningioma with progression of disease and significant brain edema. patient: What does that mean? doctor: It means that the tumor has grown and is causing swelling in your brain. This is causing your symptoms, such as the seizures, hemiparesis, and confusion. patient: So what can be done about it? doctor: Unfortunately, there are no good treatment options for malignant meningioma. Chemotherapy is an option, but you're not in a condition to receive it. Surgery is another option, but I don't think it would be in your best interest. The likelihood of benefit from surgery is small, and there's a good chance that you wouldn't be able to recover. patient: I don't understand. Why wouldn't surgery help? doctor: Because the tumor is so aggressive, it's likely to come back even after surgery. And the surgery itself is very risky. You could end up with more problems than you have now. patient: So what are my options? doctor: I'm afraid there aren't any good options. The best we can do is try to manage your symptoms and make you as comfortable as possible. patient: That's it? There's nothing else that can be done? doctor: I'm sorry, but that's the reality of the situation. patient: (Silence) doctor: I know this is a lot to take in. I'm here to answer any questions you have. patient: (Silence) doctor: I'm going to give you some information about malignant meningioma and the different treatment options. I'll also give you a referral to a palliative care specialist. They can help you manage your symptoms and provide support to you and your family. patient: Thank you. doctor: You're welcome. I'm here if you need anything else.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT New patient evaluation.

"doctor: Hello, Mr./Ms. patient, thank you for coming in today. I understand you're here for complaints of low back and right thigh pain. patient: That's right, doctor. It's been going on for a while now, and it's really starting to affect my daily life. doctor: I see. Can you tell me a little bit more about the pain? Where exactly do you feel it, and how would you describe it? patient: It's mostly in my lower back, between L4 and the sacrum. It's a sharp, stabbing pain that sometimes radiates down my right thigh. It's been especially bad lately, and I've been having trouble sleeping and working. doctor: I understand. Have you seen a doctor about this before? patient: Yes, I was seen in your clinic on 04/12/05. I was prescribed a Medrol Dosepak, and it helped reduce the pain a bit. But it's still there, and it's still interfering with my life. doctor: I see. Well, let's take a look at your back and see if we can find anything that might be causing the pain. The doctor performs a physical examination of the patient's back. doctor: Your range of motion is limited, and you're tender to palpation. There's no overt muscular spasm, and your reflexes are symmetric. patient: So what does that mean? doctor: Well, it means that there's something going on in your back that's causing the pain. It could be a herniated disc, or it could be something else. We'll need to do some more tests to figure it out. patient: What kind of tests? doctor: We'll start with an MRI. That will give us a detailed look at your spine and help us see what's causing the pain. patient: Okay. And what happens after that? doctor: Once we know what's causing the pain, we can start treating it. We may need to prescribe medication, or we may need to do surgery. But we'll take it one step at a time. patient: I'm glad to hear that. I'm ready to do whatever it takes to get rid of this pain. doctor: I'm glad to hear that. We'll work together to get you feeling better. The doctor and patient discuss the patient's medical history, including his previous back surgeries and his current medications. doctor: Okay, Mr./Ms. patient, I've reviewed your medical history and your test results. I've also examined your back. I believe that you have a herniated disc at L4-L5. This is a condition in which the soft, jelly-like center of an intervertebral disc pushes through the tough outer layer of the disc. This can cause pain, numbness, and weakness in the back and legs. patient: So what can we do about it? doctor: There are a few different treatment options for a herniated disc. We can start with conservative treatment, such as physical therapy and pain medication. If that doesn't help, we may need to consider surgery. patient: I'm not sure I want to have surgery. doctor: I understand. Surgery is always a last resort. But if conservative treatment doesn't help, it may be the best option for you. patient: I'll think about it. doctor: Okay. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a new pain medication. I'm also going to refer you to a physical therapist. patient: Thank you, doctor. doctor: You're welcome. I'm here to help.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Low back and right thigh pain.

"doctor: Hello Mrs./Ms. patient, thank you for coming in today. I understand you're here because of some back pain and right leg pain. Can you tell me a little bit more about that? patient: Sure. I've been having back pain and right leg pain for about two years now. It started after I was diagnosed with small cell lung cancer. The cancer has spread to my femurs, lower lumbar spine, and pelvis. doctor: I see. So, the pain started after your cancer diagnosis and has been ongoing since then? patient: Yes, that's right. I've had numerous chemotherapy and radiation treatments, but the pain hasn't gone away. I just finished a series of 10 radiation treatments for pain relief, but it didn't help much. doctor: I understand. Can you describe the pain in more detail? Where exactly do you feel it, and what does it feel like? patient: The pain is mostly in my low back on the right side. It radiates down the back of my right leg to my knee. I also have some numbness in the bottom of my left foot, and some sharp pain in the left foot at times. The pain is sharp, dull, and aching. It's a 10 out of 10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst possible pain. doctor: Okay, and what makes the pain worse or better? patient: It seems to be worse while sitting in the car for a long time, standing, or walking. doctor: I see. And what medications are you taking for the pain? patient: I'm on Duragesic patch 250 mcg total, Celebrex 200 mg once daily, iron 240 mg twice daily, Paxil 20 mg daily, and Percocet.

We generally don't perform injections while patients are on warfarin, but since you're on a very small dose and have had previous biopsies while on it without any complications, we should be okay. patient: That sounds good. doctor: I've also asked that you stop taking Paxil and start taking Cymbalta instead.

I'm not sure why I'm here, but I had a stroke. doctor: I see. Well, let's start by going over your medical history. You have a history of coronary artery disease and had bypass grafting surgery in the past. Do you remember when and where that was? patient: I'm not sure. I don't remember much about it. doctor: That's okay. We can look that up in your chart. It also says here that you have carotid artery stenosis and had right carotid artery stenting. Again, do you recall when that was? patient: No, I don't remember that either. doctor: No problem. Additionally, you have diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a history of stroke with left-sided hemiplegia. patient: Yes, I remember having a stroke. doctor: I understand. Now, let's talk about your current symptoms. You mentioned confusion. Can you tell me more about that? patient: Well, I've been feeling disoriented and forgetful. I also had trouble speaking and understanding others. doctor: I see. And have you experienced any chest discomfort, shortness of breath, or palpitations? patient: No, I haven't had any of those symptoms. doctor: That's good to hear. I've reviewed your EKG and telemetry results. It shows that you have atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. However, your current telemetry shows normal sinus rhythm. patient: What does that mean? doctor: Atrial fibrillation is a heart rhythm disorder where the upper chambers of your heart (the atria) beat irregularly and rapidly. This can lead to a rapid heart rate and an increased risk of stroke. patient: That sounds serious. doctor: It can be, but we're going to take steps to manage it. I've consulted with cardiology, and we recommend starting you on Coumadin to prevent further strokes. However, given your current neurological status, we need to assess your risk of falling. If the risk is low, we'll proceed with Coumadin. Otherwise, we'll consider aspirin and Plavix. patient: I understand. doctor: Additionally, you have carotid artery stenosis. We'll order a CT angio of the carotid to assess stent patency. However, given your recent stroke, revascularization is not indicated at this time. patient: Okay. doctor: Finally, you have coronary artery disease, but you're clinically stable.

However, I did notice that you have some difficulty with your balance and coordination. patient: Yes, I've been having trouble walking lately. I use a walker to get around. doctor: I see. Well, based on your symptoms and the results of my exam, I think you may have a condition called benign positional vertigo (BPPV). BPPV is a common cause of dizziness, and it's usually caused by a problem with the inner ear. patient: What can I do about it? doctor: There are a few things we can do. First, I'm going to prescribe you a medication called Antivert. This medication can help to reduce the dizziness. I'm also going to schedule you for some tests, including a CT scan of your head and an ENG test. These tests will help us to confirm the diagnosis of BPPV and rule out other possible causes of your dizziness. patient: Okay. doctor: I'm also going to recommend that you see a physical therapist. A physical therapist can teach you some exercises that can help to improve your balance and coordination. patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help. doctor: You're welcome.

"doctor: Good morning, Mr. patient, thank you for coming in today. I understand you've been experiencing some heart failure symptoms. Can you tell me more about what you've been feeling? patient: Well, I've been feeling generally okay, but I've been stressed and fatigued. I work hard running three companies, and I've noticed shortness of breath with exertion and occasional shortness of breath at rest. I've also had some PND, but I sleep on one pillow. I don't have any edema now, but I've had some mild leg swelling in the past. I've never had any angina, palpitations, syncope, or near syncope. When I take my pulse, I notice some irregularity. I don't follow any special diet and I don't get regular exercise, although I've recently started walking for half an hour a day. Over the past year, these symptoms have been slowly getting worse. I've also gained about 20 pounds. doctor: I see. Do you have any history of heart failure or other heart problems? patient: No, I don't. doctor: What about your past medical history? Any notable conditions or surgeries? patient: I had a right inguinal hernia repair in 1982 and trauma to my right thumb. I don't have a history of high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, or heart murmur. doctor: Okay. Now, let's talk about your social history. Where do you live, and who do you live with? patient: I live in San Salvador with my wife. I have a lot of stress in my life. I don't smoke, but I do drink. I have a high school education. doctor: And your family history? Any heart conditions or other significant illnesses? patient: My mother is alive at age 89. My father died at 72 of a heart attack. I have two brothers and one sister, all of whom are healthy, although my oldest brother suffered a myocardial infarction. I have three healthy girls and nine healthy grandchildren. doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. I'm going to perform a comprehensive cardiovascular examination now. The doctor performs the examination. doctor: Based on my examination, I've noted a few findings. Your blood pressure is 120/70 in each arm seated, your pulse is 80 beats per minute and regular, and your breathing is 12 times per minute and unlabored. Your heart rhythm is regular, and your first and second heart sounds are normal. However, you do have a fourth heart sound and a soft systolic murmur. Your precordial impulse is enlarged. Your lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion, and your abdomen is soft without hepatosplenomegaly or masses. You don't have any clubbing, cyanosis, or peripheral edema. Your distal pulses are normal throughout both arms and both legs. Neurologically, your mentation, mood, and affect are normal, and you're oriented to person, place, and time. doctor: I've also reviewed your test results. Your EKG shows sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy, and your metabolic stress test indicates mild cardiopulmonary disease. Your laboratory data shows normal TSH, glucose, creatinine, potassium, and hematocrit. Your urinalysis was also normal. I've also reviewed your echocardiogram, which shows a dilated cardiomyopathy with an EF of 15% and a left ventricular diastolic dimension of 6.8 cm. There are no significant valvular abnormalities. Your stress thallium showed no scintigraphic evidence of stress-induced myocardial ischemia, but there is a fixed small-sized mild-to-moderate intensity perfusion defect in the distal inferior wall and apex, which may be an old infarct. doctor: Based on all of this information, it appears that you have a newly diagnosed dilated cardiomyopathy. The etiology of this is uncertain, but there is a strong genetic component. We'll need to do some family screening to make sure your siblings and children haven't developed the same condition. patient: What does this mean for me? doctor: Well, we'll need to start you on some medications to help manage your condition. I'm going to prescribe an ACE inhibitor, lisinopril, and a beta-blocker, carvedilol. We'll start with low doses and gradually increase them over the next few weeks. I'll also recommend that you start taking a loop diuretic, such as furosemide, to help reduce fluid retention. In addition, you should make some lifestyle changes, such as eating a healthy diet, getting regular exercise, and managing your stress. patient: I'll do whatever it takes to get better. doctor: I'm confident that we can help you manage your condition and improve your quality of life. I'll see you again in 3 to 6 months to check on your progress. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to call my office.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Heart failure symptoms.

Your abdomen is soft, non-tender without hepatosplenomegaly, and normal bowel sounds. Your extremities show no edema today. You're awake, alert, and attentive. You were able to get up on to the examination table and out of a chair with normal gait. You have bilateral OA changes of the knee. patient: Yes, my right knee has been bothering me. doctor: I see. Well, your creatinine is down to 1.7, which is an improvement from your last visit when it was 2.3. Your A1c is also improved, down to 7.6 from 8.5. Your total cholesterol is 192, your HDL is 37, and your triglycerides are 487. patient: What do you think about my triglycerides? doctor: Well, at your last visit, you had 3+ protein in your urine. Your TSH was normal. We're going to get a 24-hour urine to rule out nephrosis as the cause of your hypertriglyceridemia. In the meantime, Dr. X and I have been considering whether you should have an agent added to treat your hypertriglyceridemia. Specifically, we were considering TriCor (fenofibrate). However, given your history of high CPK values, we've decided not to do that for now. We'll leave that option open for the future. We'll also check a fasting lipid panel today. patient: Okay. doctor: Now, let's talk about your arthritis. You can use Extra Strength Tylenol up to 4 grams a day, but I suggest that you start with a regular dose of 1 to 2 to 3 grams per day. You can increase the dose gradually if needed. As for a brace, you mentioned that you've used one in the past and it didn't help much. I'm a little concerned about the tourniquet effect of a brace, which could increase your edema or put you at risk for venous thromboembolic disease. So, for now, you should continue using your cane and walker. patient: I'll do that. doctor: Finally, I'm going to give you a flu vaccination today. patient: Thank you. doctor: You're welcome. I'd like to see you back in 3 months. If you have any problems before then, please don't hesitate to call the office. patient: I will. Thank you, doctor.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Right knee pain.

Can you tell me more about that? patient: Well, I had some chest pain a while back, but it's gone away now. I'm not sure why I was sent to the hospital. doctor: I see.

This can cause chest pain, shortness of breath, and fatigue. patient: Oh, I didn't know that. doctor: I understand that you're hesitant about having surgery, but it's important to weigh the risks and benefits.

"doctor: Good morning, patient. Thank you for coming in today. I understand you're here for a second opinion on your kyphosis. patient: That's right. I've been noticing a round back posture for a while now, and my parents took me to another orthopedist who recommended observation. I wanted to get a second opinion to see if there are any other treatment options. doctor: I see. Well, let's start with a few questions. Are you experiencing any pain in your back or any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your upper or lower extremities? patient: No, I don't have any pain or numbness. doctor: Okay. And have you had any problems with your bowels or bladder? patient: No, everything's been normal. doctor: That's good to hear. Now, I'm going to do a physical exam to get a better understanding of your condition. The doctor performs a physical exam, checking the patient's skin, muscles, and range of motion. doctor: Based on my exam, it appears that you have a mild kyphosis. Your skin is intact with no rashes or lesions, and there's no evidence of paraspinal muscle spasm. You have full strength in all muscle groups, and your sensation is intact to light touch. Your X-rays also showed a 46-degree kyphosis. patient: So, what does this mean? doctor: Well, kyphosis is a condition where the spine curves abnormally forward. In your case, the curve is mild and is likely within the normal range for an adolescent. However, we'll need to monitor it closely to make sure it doesn't progress. patient: What are my treatment options? doctor: There are three main options: observation, physical therapy, and bracing. Since your kyphosis is mild and you're still growing, we can start with observation and physical therapy. The physical therapy will focus on extension-based strengthening exercises, flexibility range of motion exercises, and postural training. We'll see you back in 3 months for repeat radiographs to assess your progress. If the kyphosis shows signs of progression, we may need to consider bracing. patient: Okay, I understand. doctor: I'm also going to give you a prescription for Ceftin to treat your ear infection. patient: Thank you. doctor: You're welcome. I'm confident that we can manage your kyphosis and help you achieve the best possible outcome.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Second opinion on kyphosis.

"doctor: Good morning, patient. I understand you're here for a second opinion regarding cataract extraction. patient: Yes, that's right. I've been told that I need cataract surgery in both eyes, but I'm nervous about having surgery. doctor: I can understand your concerns. Cataract surgery is a major surgery, and it's natural to be nervous. I'm here to answer any questions you have and help you make the best decision for your eyes. patient: Well, I've had laser surgery four times to the macula in my right eye and twice in my left eye. I see Dr. X for that. doctor: I see. Dr. X is a very good ophthalmologist. I'm sure he's given you excellent care. patient: He has. But I'm still worried about cataract surgery. I'm afraid it will make my vision worse. doctor: I can understand your concerns. However, I want to assure you that cataract surgery is a very safe and effective procedure. In most cases, it can significantly improve vision. patient: Really? doctor: Yes. Cataracts are a clouding of the lens of the eye. They can cause blurry vision, glare, and difficulty seeing at night. Cataract surgery removes the cloudy lens and replaces it with a clear artificial lens. This can often restore vision to near-normal levels. patient: That's encouraging. But what about my macular degeneration? doctor: Macular degeneration is a serious condition that can lead to vision loss. However, cataract surgery can actually help to slow the progression of macular degeneration. By removing the cataracts, we can improve the clarity of the images that reach the macula. This can help to preserve vision and prevent further damage. patient: That's good to know. I think I'm starting to feel a little better about cataract surgery. doctor: I'm glad to hear that. I know it's a big decision, but I'm confident that cataract surgery is the right choice for you. patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help. doctor: You're welcome.

Well, Mrs. Patient, based on your symptoms and medical history, I think it's likely that you're experiencing angina pectoris. This is a condition in which the blood flow to your heart is reduced, causing chest pain. Patient: What causes angina pectoris? Doctor: There are a number of things that can cause angina pectoris, including coronary artery disease, which is a narrowing of the arteries that supply blood to your heart. Smoking, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure are all risk factors for coronary artery disease. Patient: So, what can I do to treat my angina? Doctor: There are a number of things we can do. First, we need to get your risk factors under control. This means quitting smoking, lowering your cholesterol, and managing your blood pressure. We may also prescribe medication to help improve blood flow to your heart and reduce chest pain. Patient: Okay, I'll do whatever it takes to get better. Doctor: I'm glad to hear that.

"doctor: Good afternoon, Mr. ABC. I'm Dr. doctor, and I'll be your cardiologist today. I understand you've been experiencing some chest pain. patient: Yes, that's right. I've been having chest pain for the past few weeks. It started out as a mild pain, but it's gotten worse over time. Now, it's severe and it comes on after just a few minutes of exercise. doctor: I see. And have you been experiencing any other symptoms, such as shortness of breath or lightheadedness? patient: No, not really. Just the chest pain. doctor: Okay. Well, I'd like to run a few tests to try to figure out what's causing your chest pain. We'll start with a stress test. patient: Sure. doctor: (After the stress test) Well, Mr. ABC, the stress test showed that you have severe chest pain after just 5 minutes of exercise. We also saw some horizontal ST depressions and moderate apical ischemia on the stress imaging. patient: What does that mean? doctor: It means that there's a blockage in your arteries that's preventing blood from flowing properly to your heart. This can cause chest pain and other symptoms. patient: Is it serious? doctor: It can be. If the blockage is severe, it can lead to a heart attack. That's why I'm recommending that we do a cardiac catheterization. patient: What's that? doctor: It's a procedure where we insert a thin tube into your artery and inject a dye that will help us see the blockage. patient: Okay. doctor: (After the cardiac catheterization) Well, Mr. ABC, the cardiac catheterization showed that you have mild-to-moderate left main distal disease, moderate proximal LAD with a severe mid-LAD lesion, and a mid-left circumflex lesion. patient: What does that mean? doctor: It means that you have a blockage in several of your arteries. The blockage in your left anterior descending artery is the most severe. This is the artery that supplies blood to the front of your heart. patient: So, what do we do now? doctor: I'm recommending that we transfer you to Medical Center for PCI. PCI is a procedure where we insert a stent into the artery to open up the blockage. patient: Okay. I'm agreeable with that. doctor: I've already spoken with Dr. X at Medical Center, and he has kindly accepted you in transfer.

Can you tell me how you've been doing since we last saw you? patient: Well, things have gotten worse. My walking and balance are much worse. I can barely walk at all now. I need a walker and help from an assistant just to stand or walk. doctor: I see. And how about your incontinence? patient: It's the same. I don't feel the need to go to the bathroom, but when I'm asked, I can tell I need to go. I wear a Depends undergarment all the time. doctor: Okay. And how is your thinking and memory? patient: They're worse too. I'm mostly apathetic. I don't talk much. I live in a skilled nursing facility in the Alzheimer's section. I do have some daytime activities and I take a nap once a day, but I don't read much anymore. doctor: I see. That's concerning. I'd like to examine you today and see if there are any changes since your last visit. doctor: (Examines the patient) Okay, Mr. patient, I've reviewed your medical history and examined you today. I'm concerned about the worsening of your gait, dementia, and incontinence. I've also noticed a new finding today, which is limited upgaze. This could be consistent with either progressive supranuclear palsy or progressive enlargement of the ventricles. patient: (Wife and daughter look at each other with concern) What does that mean? doctor: Well, it means that we need to consider all the possible causes of your symptoms and determine the best course of treatment. One option is to try a trial of CSF drainage via spinal catheter again. This is a procedure where we insert a thin tube into your spinal canal to drain excess cerebrospinal fluid. We did this over a year ago at Hospital, but it didn't seem to help at the time. However, your ventricles appear to be larger now than they were a year ago, so it's possible that hydrocephalus is still contributing to your symptoms. wife: (Hesitantly) So, you're saying that there's a chance that surgery could help? doctor: Yes, that's right. But it's important to understand that there is no guarantee. The success of shunt surgery depends on many factors, including the underlying cause of your symptoms. daughter: (With a sigh) I guess we have a lot to think about. doctor: I understand. I've given you a printed prescription of the protocol including its rationale, risks, benefits, and alternatives.

The patient also reports mild difficulty getting out of a chair but denies any back pain, bowel or bladder issues, or frank lower extremity weakness. He is currently taking Plavix and Synthyroid. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. TIA-like event Assessment: Given his history of a TIA-like event, the symptoms he experienced are concerning for a possible recurrent TIA. Although his neurological evaluation, CT scan, carotid Dopplers, and echocardiogram were normal, a CT angiogram is warranted to evaluate the integrity of his cerebrovascular system. Plan: - Obtain CT angiogram of the cerebral vessels. - Review the workup done at the outside hospital to avoid repeating unnecessary tests. - Continue Plavix. Follow-up instructions: - Follow up in clinic in 1 week. 2. Lumbar stenosis Assessment: Patient has mild difficulty getting out of a chair. However, he is very active and plays tennis at least three times a week. He also has never had any bowel or bladder incontinence or frank lower extremity weakness, suggesting mild lumbar stenosis. Plan: - Patient is not interested in surgical intervention at this time. Therefore, we will defer further evaluation with a CT myelogram. Follow-up instructions: - Follow up in clinic in 1 week.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT The patient is a pleasant age-year-old male who presents to the clinic for a follow-up on his recent TIA-like event. The patient reports that he was driving his car when suddenly his vision started to decrease. He felt nauseated and lightheaded during the episode. The vision loss lasted for about five minutes, and the patient reported no other symptoms, such as headaches, gait change, or focal weakness. He reported no bowel or bladder incontinence or frank lower extremity weakness. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. Lumbar stenosis Assessment: The patient has mild difficulty getting out of a chair. He has no back pain or pain of any type. He is currently taking Plavix and Synthroid, is that correct? He will continue his current prescription. He will also receive a CT angiogram of his cerebral vessels to evaluate the integrity of his cerebrovascular system. Plan: - Continue his current treatment regimen. - Consult neurologist for further evaluation. Follow-up instructions will be provided at his next visit. 2. Cerebral vessels integrity Assessment: Patient has a history of cerebral vessels integrity assessment, including an MRI, carotid Dopplers, an echocardiogram, and a neurological evaluation. The neurologist suggested a CT myelogram, which would determine if the patient is interested in surgical intervention at this time. - Plan: Patient will continue to continue his existing treatment regimen, which includes his current Plvix, Synthodrol, and Plvax. - Follow-ups will be scheduled at his subsequent follow-ups. 3. Neurological system Integrity Assessment: This patient's recent vision loss was due to a sudden vision loss. He was given a CT scan, which came back normal. He also had an MRI at the outside hospital, which was also normal. However, the neurologist recommended further evaluation at the clinic. Patient will follow up on his next appointment. Follow up instructions: - Follow up with his neurologist, who will provide additional information on his neurological system. 4. Neurology System Integrity Assessment - The patient's neurologist has been following up with the clinic since his recent vision-loss episode. His neurological system integrity assessment has been determined to be normal. - Patient will be given additional instructions on his neurology system assessment. Follow - up instructions will include his next neurology exam, which will include further evaluation of the patient's cerebral vessels. 5."
"doctor: Good morning, Mr./Ms. patient. How are you doing today? patient: I'm not doing so well, doctor. I've been having some abdominal pain. doctor: I see. Can you tell me more about the pain? Where is it located? patient: It's mostly in my lower abdomen, but it sometimes radiates to my back. doctor: How long have you been having the pain? patient: For about a week now. doctor: Have you noticed anything else unusual, such as changes in your bowel movements or urination? patient: Yes, I've been having more frequent urination and it burns when I go. doctor: I see. Well, I'm going to examine you now to try to figure out what's causing your pain. doctor: (Examines the patient's abdomen) Your abdomen is soft and nontender. There is no organomegaly or CVA tenderness. No hernias are noted. doctor: (Checks the patient's vital signs) Your blood pressure is 120/80 mmHg, your pulse is 80 bpm, and your respirations are 12 pm. You are afebrile. doctor: Based on your symptoms and examination, I think you have a urinary tract infection (UTI). patient: A UTI? What is that? doctor: A UTI is an infection of the urinary tract, which includes the bladder, urethra, and kidneys. It is usually caused by bacteria that enter the urethra and travel up into the bladder. patient: How do I get a UTI? doctor: UTIs are more common in women than in men, but they can occur in anyone. There are a number of things that can increase your risk of getting a UTI, such as having diabetes, being sexually active, or using a catheter. patient: I have diabetes. Could that be why I got a UTI? doctor: Yes, diabetes can increase your risk of getting a UTI. That's because high blood sugar levels can damage the nerves that control the bladder, making it more difficult to empty the bladder completely. This can lead to bacteria building up in the bladder and causing an infection. doctor: I'm going to prescribe you some antibiotics to treat the UTI. I also want you to see an endocrinologist to help you manage your diabetes. patient: Okay, I will. Thank you, doctor. doctor: You're welcome.

Doctor: I see. Can you tell me more about your symptoms? Patient: Well, I have a lot of sneezing, a runny nose, and itchy, watery eyes. My nose is also stuffy and I have a sore throat. Doctor: How long have you been experiencing these symptoms? Patient: For about two weeks now. Doctor: Have you tried any medications to relieve your symptoms? Patient: Yes, I've tried Claritin, Zyrtec, and Allegra. They all worked for a short time, but then they seemed to stop working. Doctor: I see. Have you tried any over-the-counter nasal sprays? Patient: No, I haven't. Doctor: Okay. Well, I think you have allergic rhinitis. This is a common condition that causes inflammation of the nasal passages. It's usually caused by an allergy to something in the environment, such as pollen, dust, or pet dander. Patient: I see. So, what can I do to treat it? Doctor: There are a few things you can do. First, you can try taking Zyrtec again. It's a different type of antihistamine than Claritin and Allegra, so it might work better for you. You can also try using loratadine. It's a non-prescription antihistamine that's also effective for treating allergic rhinitis. Patient: Okay, I'll try that. Doctor: I'm also going to give you some samples of Nasonex nasal spray. This is a prescription nasal spray that can help to reduce inflammation and congestion. You should use it twice a day for three weeks. Patient: Okay, thank you. Doctor: You're welcome. I'm also going to write you a prescription for Nasonex in case you need more after three weeks. Patient: Thank you. Doctor: You're welcome. I hope this helps.

I was just sitting watching TV and I felt sleepy, so I went to the bathroom to urinate before going to bed. While I was trying to lift the seat, I tripped and fell and hit my head on the toilet seat. It started bleeding and I had pain in the area with a headache. I didn't lose consciousness, though. I went and woke up my sister, and she brought a towel to cover the laceration on the back of my head and called EMS. They came to my house and brought me to the emergency room. doctor: I see. And what happened after you got to the emergency room? patient: They found that I had a laceration on the back of my head, which they stapled. They also did a CT of my head and ruled out any acute intracranial pathology. But my ammonia levels were found to be markedly elevated at 106, so I'm being admitted for management of that. doctor: Okay, I understand. Have you been having any other symptoms besides the fall and the head injury? patient: No, I haven't had any abdominal pain, change in bowel habits, GI bleed, hematemesis, melena, or hematochezia. I've been taking my medications, but I can't remember what they are. I also don't remember having any symptoms prior to the fall. doctor: I see.

"patient: Doctor, I've been having some problems with my left leg swelling. It's been going on for about three years now, but it's gotten worse in the past few months.

It's hard to get my hand behind my back or behind my head, and I've lost some strength in my left shoulder. The back pain is more of a dull ache, and I think it's probably from my mattress. doctor: I see. And have you had any blood work done recently? patient: Yes, I had some blood work done in April, and my white blood cell count was elevated. Dr. XYZ referred me to Dr. XYZ, but he didn't seem too concerned about it and told me to just come back here for follow-up. doctor: Okay. I'll take a look at your blood work results. Anything else you've been experiencing? patient: I've also been having increased frequency of urination, especially at night. I have to get up two or three times to use the bathroom.

Well, let's take a look at your leg and do a physical exam. doctor: (Examines the patient's leg) Your left leg is definitely swollen. There's at least 2+ pedal edema. Your right leg has just a trace of edema. I'm also going to order a venous Doppler of your left leg and a CBC and metabolic panel. I'm going to start you on Detrol 0.4 mg once daily and Mobic 15 mg per day. patient: Okay. What else can I do to help with the swelling? doctor: Elevate your leg as much as possible and wear support hose if you can. Keep your foot up during the day. We'll see you back in two weeks to review the results of the Doppler and lab work and see how you're doing with the Detrol and the joint pain. If your shoulder pain is not any better, we'll probably refer you to an orthopedist.

"doctor: Hello, Mr. patient, I understand you're here today because you experienced a brief episode of visual loss three weeks ago. Can you tell me more about what happened? patient: Sure, doctor. I was driving my car when my vision started to decrease. It felt like a black sheet was coming down from the top, compressing my vision. The episode lasted about five minutes, and I was able to pull over to the side of the road safely. I felt nauseated and lightheaded during the episode, and my wife said I looked very pale and ashen. doctor: That sounds concerning. Did you seek medical attention at the time? patient: Yes, I went to the clinic and had a CT scan, carotid Dopplers, an echocardiogram, and a neurological evaluation. Everything came back normal. The doctor suggested I get a CT angiogram since I can't have an MRI due to my pacemaker. doctor: I see. Have you had any similar episodes since then? patient: No, I haven't. My vision has been fine since that one episode. doctor: That's good to hear. Now, let's talk about your lumbar stenosis. You mentioned that you've been diagnosed with it, but you don't have any significant pain or other symptoms. Is that correct? patient: That's right. I've had some mild difficulty getting out of a chair, but other than that, I'm very active. I play tennis three times a week and don't have any back pain or weakness. doctor: I understand. So, you're not interested in surgical intervention at this time? patient: No, I'm not. I'm managing well with my current level of activity. doctor: Okay, we can defer further evaluation with a CT myelogram for now. We'll continue to monitor your lumbar stenosis and see how you do. patient: Thank you, doctor. doctor: You're welcome. Now, let's discuss your medications. You're currently taking Plavix, Proscar, and Synthroid, is that correct? patient: Yes, that's right. doctor: We'll continue the Plavix and Synthroid.

Can you tell me a little bit more about it? patient: (unable to provide further history) doctor (to the patient's son): Can you tell me anything about your father's symptoms? son: He started having severe pain in his abdomen yesterday. He was also very confused and disoriented. We took him to the emergency room, where they did a CT scan. The scan showed that he has a dilated bladder with a thick wall, suggesting an outlet obstruction, as well as bilateral hydronephrosis and hydroureter. doctor: Thank you for that information. I'm going to examine your father now. (Doctor performs physical examination) doctor: Your father is currently afebrile. His pulse is 52, respirations are 20, blood pressure is 104/41, and he is saturating 98% on room air. He is awake but not oriented x3 and is in no acute distress. His pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. Extraocular movements are intact. Mucous membranes are dry. Neck is supple with no thyromegaly or jugular venous distention. Heart is irregularly irregular and bradycardic. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally anteriorly. Abdomen has positive normoactive bowel sounds, is soft, and has tenderness in the suprapubic region without rebound. There is no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema in the upper or lower extremities. doctor: Based on your father's symptoms and the results of his CT scan, I believe he has sepsis.

I understand you're here for a follow-up after your total left knee arthroplasty. patient: (nods slightly) doctor: How are you feeling today? patient: (mumbles incoherently) doctor: I see you're a bit drowsy. Is that from the morphine you received for pain? patient: (nods) doctor: That's understandable. I'm going to ask you a few questions to get a better understanding of your situation. Is that okay? patient: (nods) doctor: Let's start with your Coumadin therapy. You were started on Coumadin after your surgery to reduce the risk of blood clots, correct? patient: (nods) doctor: However, your prothrombin time and INR levels rose to supratherapeutic levels, even after Coumadin was discontinued. Is that right? patient: (nods) doctor: We're suspecting that you may have a hypersensitivity to Coumadin. Have you ever had a reaction to Coumadin or any other medications in the past? patient: (shakes head) doctor: I see. We've consulted with the hematology/oncology team, and they've recommended some further evaluation and management. We're going to give you an injection of vitamin K right now, as oral vitamin K is more effective but you're not able to take anything by mouth at the moment. We'll repeat your prothrombin time and INR levels in the morning. Once your levels are within a more therapeutic range, we'll start you on low-molecular-weight heparin, either Fragmin once a day or Lovenox twice a day, for 4 to 6 weeks after your surgery. patient: (nods) doctor: I understand this can be a lot to take in. We'll keep a close eye on you and make sure you're recovering well. Do you have any questions for me? patient: (shakes head) doctor: Okay. We'll be back to check on you soon. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. patient: (nods) doctor: Thank you, Mrs. patient.

Can you tell me more about your pain? patient: Well, I've been having neck pain for years. It's a constant, aching pain that sometimes shoots down my arms. I also have pain in my mid-back and lower back. The pain in my lower back is worse when I sit or stand for long periods of time. And I've been having pain in my right leg for the past few years. It's a sharp, burning pain that starts in my lower back and goes down to my foot. doctor: Have you seen any other doctors about this pain? patient: Yes, I've seen Dr. Ninan Matthew in the past. He diagnosed me with osteoarthritis, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia. I've also seen Dr. Bonaparte for my hyperlipidemia and hypothyroidism. doctor: I see.

"doctor: Hello, patient, I'm doctor, the surgeon who will be evaluating you today. I understand you've been referred to me for a thyroid mass that was recently diagnosed as papillary carcinoma. Can you tell me a little bit more about your symptoms? patient: Sure. I first noticed a small lump in my thyroid about a year ago. It didn't bother me at first, but it started to get bigger recently. I went to the Pediatric Endocrinology Department, and they did a fine needle aspiration biopsy, which confirmed it was papillary thyroid carcinoma. doctor: I see. Have you experienced any other symptoms, such as hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, or weight changes? patient: No, I haven't had any of those symptoms. My weight has been stable, and I don't have any trouble swallowing or speaking. doctor: That's good to hear. Do you have any family history of thyroid cancer or other endocrine disorders? patient: Not that I know of. My father mentioned that his mother had thyroid surgery, but he's not sure if it was for cancer or goiter. doctor: Okay. I'll make a note of that. Now, let's take a closer look at your neck. (The doctor performs a physical examination of the patient's neck.) doctor: I can feel a slightly visible midline bulge in the region of the thyroid isthmus. There's also a firm nodule there, and some nodularity in the right lobe of the thyroid. The mass is relatively hard and slightly fixed, but it doesn't seem to be tethered to the surrounding tissues, skin, or muscles. I also noticed some shotty adenopathy in the area, but no supraclavicular nodes. patient: Does that mean the cancer has spread? doctor: It's possible, but we can't be sure until we do some further testing. I'd like to order a chest x-ray and review your laboratory data from the Diagnostics Lab. patient: Okay. (The doctor orders the tests and reviews the patient's medical history.) doctor: I see that you have a mild abnormality in your AST levels, but your T4, TSH, and free thyroxine levels are all normal. Your serum pregnancy test is also negative. Unfortunately, there's no level of thyroglobulin recorded on this. patient: What does all that mean? doctor: Well, the AST abnormality is not a major concern, but it's something we'll want to keep an eye on. The normal T4, TSH, and free thyroxine levels indicate that your thyroid is still functioning properly. The negative pregnancy test is important because we can't use radioactive iodine therapy if you're pregnant. And the thyroglobulin level is a marker for thyroid cancer, so we'll need to get that checked as soon as possible. patient: I see. doctor: Now, let's talk about the chest x-ray. The radiologist noted a diffuse pattern of tiny nodules in both lungs, which is typical of miliary metastatic disease that is often seen in patients with metastatic thyroid carcinoma. This is unfortunate because it generally means a more advanced stage of disease. patient: (Visibly upset) Oh no. Does that mean the cancer has spread to my lungs? doctor: It's possible, but we can't be sure until we do a biopsy. I'll need to discuss this with the oncology team and see what they recommend. (The doctor spends the next 30 minutes discussing the surgical aspects of the treatment with the patient and her family.) doctor: I recommend performing a total thyroidectomy to remove the primary source of the cancer and eradicate as much of the native thyroid tissue as possible. We'll also do a sentinel node dissection to check for the spread of cancer to the lymph nodes. patient: What are the risks of surgery? doctor: There are a few potential risks, including damage to the recurrent laryngeal and external laryngeal branches of the nerve supplying the vocal cord function, which could lead to hoarseness or difficulty speaking. There's also a risk of hypoparathyroidism if all four of the parathyroid glands are damaged during the operation, which could lead to low calcium levels and other complications. patient: That's a lot to take in. doctor: I understand. This is a lot to process, and I'm here to answer any questions you have. (The doctor and the patient's family continue to discuss the surgery and the potential risks and benefits.) doctor: I've made every effort to get you scheduled for surgery within the next 48 hours. We're tentatively planning on proceeding this upcoming Friday afternoon with total thyroidectomy. In the meantime, I'll order the necessary tests and consult with the oncology team to discuss the best course of treatment. patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help. doctor: You're welcome.

"doctor: Good morning, Mr. patient, I'm Dr. doctor. I understand you're here for evaluation of your pneumothorax and subcutaneous emphysema. Can you tell me a little bit about what's been going on? patient: Sure. It all started on Monday when I had this sharp pain in my shoulder blade. I went to the emergency room, and they did a CT scan that showed I had a small pneumothorax and a lot of subcutaneous emphysema. They admitted me for observation. doctor: I see. And how have you been feeling since then? patient: The pain in my shoulder blade has gotten better, but my voice has been hoarse, and I still have some shortness of breath. doctor: Okay.

And your skin shows significant subcutaneous emphysema in the upper chest and anterior neck area, although you say it's improved since yesterday. patient: Yes, it's definitely gotten better. doctor: That's good to hear. I've reviewed your CT scan results, and I agree with the radiologist's impression that you have a small pneumothorax and subcutaneous emphysema. The most likely cause is either a parenchymal lung tear or a small tracheobronchial tree rend. patient: What does that mean? doctor: It means that there's a tear in the lining of your lung or in the small airways. This can happen from trauma, like a fall or a car accident. patient: I haven't had any accidents recently. doctor: It's possible that the tear happened spontaneously. This is more common in people who have certain lung conditions, like emphysema or asthma. Do you have any history of lung problems? patient: No, I don't. doctor: Okay.

"doctor: Hello, patient. Thank you for coming in today. I understand you've been experiencing some unusual spells recently. Can you tell me more about what's been happening? patient (father): Sure. Patient's name has been having these brief periods where she pauses and stares. She becomes unresponsive, but she doesn't lose her balance or fall. doctor: How long do these spells typically last? patient (mother): They vary. I've seen them last anywhere from 10 to 15 seconds, but patient's father says they can last up to 3 or 4 minutes. doctor: I see. Have you noticed anything else unusual during these spells, like any changes in her breathing or skin color? patient (mother): Yes, actually. During one of the spells outside a store recently, her lips turned blue for a few seconds. But she's never had any convulsions or shaking. doctor: That's important information. Now, I'd like to ask you a few questions about patient's name's medical history. She has a history of febrile seizures, correct? patient (father): Yes, that's right. She's been taking Keppra to prevent them, and it's been working well. doctor: I see. Has there been any change in her Keppra dosage recently? patient (mother): No, she's still taking the same dose, 150 mg twice a day. doctor: Okay. I'd like to perform a physical examination to gather more information. If that's alright with you. patient (parents): Sure, go ahead. doctor: (Conducts physical examination) doctor: Based on your symptoms and examination findings, I believe patient's name may be experiencing partial complex seizures or possibly nonconvulsive generalized seizures. We'll need to do an EEG to confirm the diagnosis. patient (father): What's an EEG? doctor: An EEG is a test that records the electrical activity in the brain. It can help us identify any abnormal patterns that may be causing the seizures. patient (mother): Will patient's name need to be sedated for the EEG? doctor: It depends. If she tolerates the procedure well, we may not need to sedate her. However, if she becomes agitated or uncomfortable, we may need to give her a mild sedative to help her relax. patient (father): Okay. What are the next steps? doctor: First, we'll try to capture an EEG as long as patient's name tolerates it. If sedation is needed, we'll defer the EEG until we adjust her seizure medications and see how she responds. I'm also increasing her Keppra dosage to 300 mg twice a day, bringing her total daily dose to just under 40 mg/kg per day. We may increase it further if the spells continue. patient (mother): When will we know the results of the EEG? doctor: I hope to review the findings first thing tomorrow morning. However, I won't delay discharging patient's name to wait for the results. We'll contact you as outpatients once we have them. patient (father): And when should we follow up with you? doctor: I'd like to see patient's name again in 5 to 6 weeks to check on her progress and schedule further follow-up appointments as needed. patient (parents): Thank you, doctor.

Can you elaborate on that? patient: Yes, I've been feeling weak and lightheaded at times, but I haven't actually fainted until the other day. doctor: I see. And you mentioned that you have a history of pulmonary embolism. Can you tell me more about that? patient: Yes, I had a pulmonary embolism a few years ago. I had a similar syncopal episode at that time. I was admitted to the hospital and had a V/Q scan, which came back positive for PE. doctor: Interesting. And what treatment did you receive for the pulmonary embolism? patient: I was anticoagulated with Coumadin, but I had a severe GI bleed as a result. So, the anticoagulation was stopped and an IVC filter was placed. doctor: I see. That's quite a history. Now, let's talk about your current medications. You mentioned that you take aspirin, Klor-Con, Lasix, Levothyroxine, Lisinopril, Pacerone, Protonix, Toprol, Vitamin B, Zetia, and Zyrtec. Is that correct? patient: Yes, that's all correct. doctor: Okay. I'm going to order some tests to help us figure out what's causing your syncopal episodes. I'd like to do a blood test, an EKG, and a chest X-ray. patient: Sure, I'm happy to do whatever it takes to get to the bottom of this. doctor: I appreciate that. I'll also refer you to a cardiologist for further evaluation. They may recommend a stress test or other specialized tests. patient: Okay, I'll follow up with them. doctor: Good. In the meantime, I want you to be cautious about activities that might trigger an episode, such as standing for long periods of time or lifting heavy objects. If you feel lightheaded or weak, lie down immediately and elevate your legs. patient: I will. Thank you for your help, doctor. doctor: You're welcome.

Can you tell me a little bit about what's been going on? patient: Sure, doctor. It all started a few months ago when I noticed swelling and discomfort in my left testicle. It's been painful off and on ever since. Then, in November, I started having pain in my upper right leg. I thought it was from skateboarding, but it didn't go away. doctor: I see. And when did you start feeling more fatigued? patient: In December, I noticed I was getting tired more easily. I used to work out regularly, but I didn't have the energy anymore. I've also lost 10 pounds since then, and my appetite has decreased. doctor: That's concerning. Did you experience any other symptoms? patient: Yes, I had night sweats and a cough in December. I was treated with Augmentin, but they didn't go away. I also started taking Accutane for acne in December, but I stopped on February 19th. doctor: I see. Now, let's talk about the more recent events. You mentioned you had severe pain in your right groin and lower quadrant on February 19th. What happened then? patient: I woke up with severe pain and went to the emergency room. They found an elevated white blood cell count and did a CT scan of my abdomen. The scan showed a large clot in my inferior vena cava extending to my right iliac and femoral veins. doctor: That sounds serious. What happened next? patient: I underwent angioplasty, placement of a vena caval filter, and mechanical and pharmacologic thrombolysis. A repeat ultrasound on February 20th showed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis. doctor: That's good news. So, you're currently taking Lovenox, Coumadin, Protonix, Vicodin, and Levaquin. Are there any allergies or past surgeries I should be aware of? patient: No known drug allergies, but I do seem to react to certain adhesives. As for past surgeries, I had the thrombosis treatment on February 19th and 20th. doctor: Okay, I've made a note of that. Now, let's discuss your family history. Do you have any relatives with medical conditions? patient: My maternal great-grandmother had deep venous thrombosis in her 40s, and my maternal great-uncle developed leukemia around age 50. My paternal grandfather died of colon cancer at age 73, and adult-onset diabetes runs in both sides of my family. doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. I'll make sure to document it in your medical record. Now, let's move on to your social history. You mentioned you're a student at the University of Denver. What are your living arrangements like? patient: I live in a dorm on campus. My parents live in Breckenridge. I admit to occasionally smoking marijuana and drinking beer with friends. doctor: I understand. Now, let's talk about your current symptoms. You mentioned nausea and constipation related to Vicodin and pain medication. You also have mild to moderate acne. Do you have any other symptoms, like shortness of breath, chest pain, headaches, joint pains, rashes, or extremity pain? patient: No, I don't have any of those symptoms, except for the right leg pain. doctor: That's good to hear. I've reviewed your physical examination results, and I'd like to order some tests to further assess your condition. We'll do a diagnostic bone marrow aspirate/biopsy and lumbar puncture.

I understand you've been experiencing some health issues lately. Can you tell me a little bit about what's been going on? patient: Sure, doctor. It all started a few months ago when I noticed swelling in my lower testicle and lower leg. I thought it was from skateboarding, but it didn't go away. Then, in November, I started having pain in my upper right leg. It's been painful since then. I've also lost 10 pounds since then, and my appetite has decreased. I used to work out regularly, but I didn't have the energy anymore. Now, let's discuss your family history. Do you have any relatives with medical conditions? Patient: Yes, my paternal great-grandmother died of colon cancer at age 73, my maternal great-uncle developed leukemia around age 50. My paternal grandfather died of colorectal cancer in his 40s, and his father died of leukemia in his 60s. As for past surgeries, I had the thromosis treatment on February 20th and underwent angioplasty, placement of a vena caval filter, and mechanical and pharmacologic thrombolysis. I also started taking Accutane for acne in December, but stopped on February 18th. I have no known drug allergies, but do seem to react to certain adhesives. I will continue to monitor my condition for any changes in the physical examination results, such as changes in blood pressure,"
"doctor: Good morning, Mr./Ms. patient, I'm Dr. doctor. I understand you've been experiencing nausea and right upper quadrant pain since yesterday evening. Can you tell me more about what's been going on? patient: Sure. I had gastric bypass surgery about a year ago and I've been doing well until yesterday evening around 7:00-8:00 when I started feeling nauseous and had pain in my right upper quadrant. The pain wrapped around to my right side and back. It feels like I'm going to vomit, but I haven't. I also feel overall malaise and have a low-grade temperature of 100.3. I haven't had any similar symptoms before. My last normal bowel movement was yesterday. I don't have any chills or blood per rectum. doctor: I see. Do you have any history of medical conditions or surgeries? patient: I have a history of hypertension and morbid obesity, but those have been resolved since my gastric bypass surgery in December 2007. doctor: That's good to hear. Are you taking any medications or have any allergies? patient: I take multivitamins and calcium. I don't have any known allergies. doctor: Okay. Do you have any family history of medical conditions? patient: My father had diabetes mellitus, but he passed away. doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Do you smoke or drink alcohol? patient: No, I don't. I work in a data entry computer job. doctor: Alright. I'm going to perform a physical exam now.

You are drowsy, but easily arousable and appropriate with conversation. You are oriented to person, place, and situation. Your sclerae are anicteric. Your mucous membranes are somewhat tacky. Your neck is supple and symmetric. Your respirations are unlabored and clear. Your heart has a regular rate and rhythm. Your abdomen is soft. You have diffuse right upper quadrant tenderness, worse focally, but no rebound or guarding. You have no organomegaly, masses, or abdominal hernias. Your extremities are symmetrical with no edema. Your posterior tibial pulses are palpable and symmetric. You are grossly nonfocal neurologically. doctor: Based on your symptoms and physical exam findings, I believe you have choledocholithiasis, possibly with cholecystitis. We'll need to admit you to the hospital and start you on IV antibiotics. We'll also get an ultrasound this morning to confirm the diagnosis. You will need your gallbladder removed, probably with an intraoperative cholangiogram. Hopefully, the stone will pass this way. Due to your anatomy, an ERCP would be difficult if not impossible unless laparoscopic assisted. Dr. X will see you later this morning to discuss the plan further. patient: Okay, I understand. Thank you for explaining everything to me.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Nausea and right upper quadrant pain.

"doctor: Good morning, Mr. ABC. How are you doing today? patient: I'm doing alright, doctor. I'm here because I've been having trouble with my vision lately. doctor: I see. Can you tell me more about that? patient: Well, over the past year, I've noticed that I'm having difficulty seeing things far away, especially when I'm driving. I'm also having trouble reading fine print up close. doctor: I understand. Do you wear glasses or contact lenses? patient: I used to wear glasses for astigmatism, but I haven't worn them in the last few years. doctor: Okay. I'm going to take a look at your eyes and see if I can find anything that might be causing your vision problems. doctor: (Examines Mr. ABC's eyes) Your visual acuity is 20/20 in your right eye and 20/40 in your left eye. Your near vision is J2 in both eyes. Your pupils are equal and reactive to light. Your extraocular movements are normal. Your intraocular pressure is 16 mmHg in your right eye and 18 mmHg in your left eye. patient: What does all that mean? doctor: Well, your visual acuity is a measure of how well you can see objects at different distances. Your near vision is how well you can see objects up close. Your pupils are the black circles in the center of your eyes. They get bigger or smaller to let more or less light into your eyes. Your extraocular movements are how well your eyes can move in different directions. Your intraocular pressure is the pressure inside your eyes. patient: Okay. So, what's wrong with my eyes? doctor: Well, I see some signs of age-related macular degeneration in your right eye. This is a condition that affects the macula, which is the part of your retina that is responsible for central vision. I also see some signs of glaucoma suspect in both eyes. This is a condition that can damage the optic nerve, which is responsible for sending signals from your eyes to your brain. patient: What can we do about it? doctor: Well, for the age-related macular degeneration, I'm going to recommend that you start taking Ocuvite PreserVision capulets twice a day. This is a supplement that can help to slow the progression of the disease. For the glaucoma suspect, I'm going to order a Humphrey visual field test and some disc photographs. These tests will help us to monitor your condition and make sure that it's not getting worse. I'm also going to refer you to the Glaucoma Clinic for further evaluation and treatment. patient: Okay.

doctor hey nicholas nice to see you today your pcp looks like he sent you over for a nonhealing foot ulcer on your right foot can you tell me about how long you've had that patient yeah i've had the boot for about six weeks i first noticed it when i put on a pair of shoes that were little bit too tight i felt some burning and some stinging and looked down and saw a blister i did n't think too much of it because it was on the pad of the bottom of my foot around my heel and i just had been walking on the front part of my foot i started to notice a foul smell and my wife mentioned something to me the other day and i noticed my dog was also smelling my socks a lot and so we looked and saw that the blister had become unroofed or the the top part of the skin of the blister became undone and then underneath it was just this really thick soft mushy skin that had a bad smell with some yellow drainage and so and barbara called the primary care doctor who then got me in to see you he started me on some antibiotics about six days ago and i never had any nausea or vomiting but my wife checked my temperature it was about ninety nine point seven and then at one point i had to put on an extra blanket in bed because i had some chills and when i started the antibiotics it started to feel pretty good but we've now noticed that it has turned black around the outside of the wound and i'm getting some cramping in my calf muscle as well and so there was a red streak also that was coming up the front part of my my ankle along the inside portion of my calf muscle and it's super super hot and so they wanted me to take a have have you look at it doctor okay thank you for sharing that history with me and did you complete that course of antibiotics patient i think he called in ten days' worth and i'm on day six or seven right now i know i've got about two or three days left doctor okay and you mentioned that it had some stinging and it was a bit uncomfortable are you experiencing any pain right now patient yeah it was it was stinging initially like i had just done something small but at this point it's it's really like throbbing it's almost like there is a fire poker in the bottom of my foot now and then the inside of my calf muscle is really hard and i've noticed that every time that i push that i feel it all the way up to my knee behind my kneecap and then noticed that i've been coughing a lot the last two days and then i've noticed that i've had like difficult time catching my breath when i'm walking around the house and so it's almost like two different things going on at this point doctor okay so now i see here in your record that you have some that you're diabetic and have some diabetic neuropathy as well how's your blood sugars been running i'm i'm assuming kind of all over the place over the last i'm gon na say probably three or four weeks can you tell me about that patient yeah my my a1c is six point seven it's pretty well controlled doctor okay patient i used to be on an insulin pump and i had an a1c that at one point was like thirteen but we worked with an endocrinologist to get it down to where it's at now i've been six point seven for probably two years now and i rarely have a blood sugar that goes over two hundred i check two or three times a day if i feel weird i'll check it again but i noticed my sugars have probably been trending in the three to four hundreds the last two weeks and then i had one spike at one point at like five or six hundred that got our attention and i think that's also what made my wife call the primary care doc doctor okay now i know this was caused by a new pair of shoes you had mentioned before to your pcp and he relayed this to me that you really like to go on hikes you and your wife have been hiking have you gone to the new trails that that were just opened up here behind the park patient yeah we actually hiked to charlie's bunion about a week before this i've had a new pair of diabetic shoes and inserts i get those every year i changed the inserts every three or four months i mean i've been in cruise control as far as that goes for some time i did get a new pair of shoes the prosthetist told me to check my feet every day for the first week or two which we did i did go hiking about the third or fourth day and i think that might be what caused it as i just went too far when we were hiking but yeah the trails are the trails are gorgeous they're open it's time to to be outside and i'm sorta stuck with this right now doctor absolutely yeah my wife and i like to go back there and and hike those trails as well so i'm gon na do a quick physical exam for your vital signs i do recognize a slight fever however your vitals themselves look good now on your foot exam i do recognize the necrotic wound on your heel as you mentioned it is present it's approximately two by two centimeters i i do recognize the sloughing of the of the tissue as well as what looks like cellulitis around the area as well as erythemia so now unfortunately i do also smell the odor you are correct it is it does it is odds but i do not appreciate any bony exposure now on vascular exam i do have bilateral palpable pulses femorally and popliteal pulses are present however i do n't recognize a palpable pulse dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial however i did use the doppler and they are present via doppler now i'm gon na press on the actual affected area of the wound do you have any pain there patient i do n't feel that right there doctor okay i'm gon na review the results of your right foot x-ray that we did when you came in today the good news is i do n't see any evidence of osteomyelitis meaning that there is no infection of the bone so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for

The patient reports the onset of symptoms approximately 6 weeks ago when he noted a blister on the pad of the bottom of his foot, around his heel. He initially did not think much of it and continued to walk on the front part of his foot. He eventually noticed a foul smell and his wife also noticed it, as well as the dog smelling his socks a lot. He looked at the blister and noted that the top part of the skin had come off, revealing thick, soft, mushy skin with a bad smell and yellow drainage. His primary care doctor started him on antibiotics 6 days ago, which initially made him feel better, but he has since noticed that the wound has turned black around the outside and he is experiencing cramping in his calf muscle. He also noted a red streak coming up the front part of his ankle along the inside portion of his calf muscle, which is very hot. He denies nausea or vomiting, but he did have a low-grade fever and chills at one point. He also reports a new onset of cough and shortness of breath over the past 2 days.

"doctor: Good morning, patient. I understand you're here for a dietary consultation during your pregnancy due to gestational diabetes. patient: Yes, that's right. I had gestational diabetes with my first pregnancy and had to use insulin. I'm not really sure what ketones are. doctor: I see.

This can be dangerous for you and your baby, so it's important to manage your blood sugar levels carefully. patient: Okay. I'll try my best. I've been walking my daughter to school and back home each day, which takes about 40 minutes total. I'm not a big milk drinker, but I do try to drink some. doctor: That's great! Exercise and a healthy diet are both important for managing gestational diabetes. I'm glad to hear you're making an effort to stay active. doctor: Let's take a look at your blood sugar records from the last week. Your fasting blood sugars have been ranging from 92 to 104, with an average of 97. Your two-hour postprandial breakfast readings have been ranging from 172 to 196, with an average of 181.

We'll also need to increase your insulin dosage. patient: Okay. I'll follow your instructions. doctor: Good. I'm also going to give you a copy of the Lily Guide for Meal Planning.

I'm currently in a Chronic Rehabilitation Unit because I can no longer use a walker and rely on a wheelchair for mobility. doctor: I see. Now, you mentioned numbness in your hands.

I do have some intermittent pain beneath the upper portion of the incision and in the right lower quadrant below my ostomy. It's not constant, but it can be quite bothersome at times. doctor: I see. And what have you been doing to manage the pain? patient: I've been taking Percocet, which works well. But I ran out, and I've been trying extra strength Tylenol, which sometimes helps. doctor: Okay. Well, I can give you a refill for the Percocet, but I want you to start weaning yourself off of it. I'd like you to try taking ibuprofen or Tylenol first, and only take the Percocet if the pain is severe. patient: Okay, I can do that. doctor: Good. Now, I also want to talk to you about your diet. You mentioned that you've been having some questions about what you can and cannot eat with your ileostomy. patient: Yes, that's right. I'm not sure what foods are safe to eat and which ones to avoid. doctor: Well, there are a few things you should keep in mind. First, you should avoid foods that are high in fiber, such as fruits and vegetables. These foods can cause diarrhea and cramping. You should also avoid foods that are high in fat, such as fried foods and fatty meats. These foods can slow down digestion and cause constipation. patient: I see. So, what can I eat? doctor: There are plenty of foods that you can eat. You can eat bananas, rice, toast, cheese, and peanut butter.

Please be sure to read it carefully. patient: I will. doctor: Now, I also want to talk to you about the numbness in your right hand and arm. This is likely due to positioning during surgery.

He presents with good wound healing, good ostomy output, and intermittent pain beneath the upper portion of the incision and in the right lower quadrant below his ostomy. The patient reports that he has been taking Percocet, which works well, but he ran out of extra strength Tylenol, which sometimes helps. The pain is not constant, but it can be bothersome at times. The numbness in his right hand and arm is likely due to positioning during surgery. He also has some intermittent pain in his lower right quadrant, which may be due to the positioning of his ileostomy. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. WOUND CONDENSITY Assessment: The patient's wound has healed nicely from surgery. The wound is healing well from the wound check, and the pain is improving over time. However, the patient's pain is still bothersome. Plan: - Continue to take ibuprofen or Tylensol first, and only take the pain if pain is severe. - Start weaning yourself off of the pain medication. - Avoid foods that are high in fiber, such as fruits and vegetables, and fatty meats. These foods can slow down digestion and cause constipation. 2. DIRTY FOODS: - The patient has been having some questions about what foods are safe to eat and which ones to avoid. - He has a history of constipation, diarrhea, and diarrhea associated with his diet. - His diet is low in fiber and low in fat. - Plan to avoid foods high in fat, which can cause diarrhea and cramping. - Follow up in six months for a routine checkup. - ASSESSMENTS AND PLAN The patient: Hi, I am the patient who presents today. I'm happy to see that you're healing nicely from your surgery. My wound is having good ostom output. I do have intermittent pain below my incision, however, which is likely the result of positioning of the ostomies. I am taking extra strength tylenol for pain. - I also have some intermittent low back pain, which I am trying to manage with extra strength tylenols. - The plan is to gradually wean yourself off the pain meds. - Continue taking extra-strength tylenols for pain management. Follow-up instructions: - I will see you back in"

patient about five to six years ago . doctor and was it relatively a normal exam ? did you have any polyps ? patient no . they said they'd see me in 10 years . doctor well that's good news . patient yeah , i agree . doctor um , do you have a pacemaker or defibrillator , or have sleep apnea , or use oxygen at night ?

"doctor: Hello, Mrs. patient, I'm Dr. doctor, a cardiologist. I'm here to talk to you about your heart condition and the recent fall you had. patient: Hello, Dr. doctor. doctor: I understand you had a fall yesterday and hit your left side on a rock. You were brought to the emergency room and found to have a rapid atrial tachyarrhythmia. You were started on Cardizem, but it was stopped because your heart rate dropped into the 50s. patient: Yes, that's right. doctor: I've reviewed your EKGs, and they show multifocal atrial tachycardia, which is a type of irregular heartbeat that starts in multiple areas of the atria, the upper chambers of your heart. However, your most recent EKG this morning shows normal sinus rhythm with frequent atrial premature contractions (APCs). Your potassium level is now 3.7, which is within the normal range. patient: I do recall having palpitations after the fall, but they've gone away since then. I haven't had any chest pain or shortness of breath before or since the fall. doctor: That's good to hear. You mentioned you can walk and climb two flights of stairs without problems. patient: Yes, that's correct. doctor: I've also reviewed your medical history. You have a history of hypertension, severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild pulmonary hypertension, and mild aortic stenosis. You've also had mitral regurgitation in the past, but it's no longer significant. You've had dizzy spells but no true syncope. You've also had bradycardia in the past from beta-blocker therapy. patient: Yes, that's all correct. doctor: I understand you're scheduled for left hip surgery. I've reviewed your medical records and I believe you're at moderate cardiac risk for the surgery. However, I think the benefits of the surgery outweigh the risks. I recommend that you proceed with the surgery as planned. We'll continue your verapamil to help control the multifocal atrial tachycardia. We'll also monitor your heart rate and optimize your electrolytes. patient: Okay, I understand. doctor: I don't think you need any further cardiac evaluation at this time. You can follow up with Dr. X after you're discharged from the hospital. patient: Thank you, Dr. doctor. doctor: You're welcome. I'll be sure to update Dr. X on your condition.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Evaluation of recent fall and rapid atrial tachyarrhythmia.

"doctor: Good morning, Ms. ABC. Thank you for coming in today. I understand you're here for a follow-up regarding your cervical spinal stenosis. patient: Yes, that's right. doctor: Okay. Let's start by talking about your symptoms. You mentioned that you've been having right upper extremity pain, paresthesias, and weakness. Can you tell me a little bit more about that? patient: Sure. The pain is mostly in my right arm and hand. It's a sharp, shooting pain that sometimes radiates down my arm. The paresthesias are like tingling and numbness. And the weakness is mostly in my right hand. I have a hard time opening jars and doors, and I often drop things. doctor: I see. And have you noticed any other symptoms, such as bowel or bladder dysfunction, lower back pain, or lower extremity pain? patient: No, I haven't had any of those symptoms. doctor: Okay. That's good to hear. I'd also like to ask you about your sleep. Have you been having any trouble sleeping? patient: Yes, actually. I've been having some sharp, shooting pain and weakness down my left upper extremity when I'm sleeping. It's really scary. doctor: I understand. That must be very difficult. patient: It is. doctor: Well, I'm glad you came in today so we can talk about this. I've reviewed your medical records, including your cervical spine MRI and radiographs. Based on your history, physical examination, and radiographic findings, it appears that you have C4-5, C5-6 cervical spinal stenosis with associated right greater than left upper extremity radiculopathy. patient: What does that mean? doctor: It means that the spinal canal in your neck is narrowed, which is putting pressure on your spinal cord and nerve roots. This can cause pain, weakness, and paresthesias in your arms and hands. patient: I see. doctor: I've discussed the diagnosis, prognosis, natural history, nonoperative, and operative treatment options with you today. We can continue with nonoperative management, such as physical therapy, or we can add cervical epidural steroid injections. We can also consider surgical intervention. patient: I'm not sure what to do. doctor: I understand. It's a big decision. I want to make sure you have all the information you need to make an informed choice. patient: Okay. doctor: Well, let's talk about the surgical option in more detail. The procedure would involve C4-5, C5-6 anterior cervical decompression and fusion. This would involve removing the bone and tissue that is compressing your spinal cord and nerve roots, and then fusing the vertebrae together to stabilize the spine. patient: What are the risks of surgery? doctor: There are some risks associated with surgery, including bleeding, infection, neurovascular injury, dural tear, singular or multiple muscle weakness, paralysis, hoarseness of voice, difficulty swallowing, pseudoarthrosis, adjacent segment disease, and the risk of this given your relatively young age. patient: That's a lot to consider. doctor: I know it is. But I want you to know that I'm confident that this surgery can help to improve your symptoms. patient: I appreciate that. doctor: You're welcome. I also want to discuss the option of disk arthroplasty. This is a newer procedure that involves replacing the damaged disk with an artificial disk. This can help to preserve motion in the spine. patient: That sounds interesting. doctor: It is. But it's important to note that disk arthroplasty is not always successful. And it's not clear whether it's better than traditional surgery in the long run. patient: I see. doctor: So, ultimately, the decision of whether or not to have surgery is up to you. I'm here to answer any questions you have and to help you make the best decision for your health. patient: Thank you. I appreciate that. doctor: You're welcome. So, what are your thoughts? patient: I think I'd like to proceed with the surgery. doctor: Okay. I'm glad to hear that. We'll schedule your surgery for August 1st. In the meantime, you'll need to complete some preoperative testing. patient: Okay. I'll do that. doctor: Good. I'm confident that this surgery will help you to get back to your old self. patient: Thank you. I hope so too.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Follow-up regarding cervical spinal stenosis.

So, we're going to admit you to the hospital today for a myringotomy and tube insertion under general facemask anesthesia. patient: What's that? doctor: It's a surgical procedure where we make a small incision in your eardrum and insert a tiny tube. This will help to drain the fluid from your middle ear and prevent future infections. patient: Okay. doctor: I'm also going to prescribe you some antibiotics to take after the surgery. patient: How long will I have to stay in the hospital? doctor: You'll probably be able to go home the same day. patient: That's a relief. doctor: I know this can be a scary time, but I want to assure you that we're going to take good care of you. patient: Thank you, doctor. doctor: You're welcome.

Your neck is clear of nodes, masses, or thyromegaly. Your lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion. Your cardiac exam shows a regular rate and rhythm, with no murmurs. Your abdomen is soft and nontender, with positive bowel sounds. doctor: Based on my examination and your history, I'm diagnosing you with chronic eustachian tube dysfunction, chronic otitis media with effusion, recurrent acute otitis media, and wax accumulation. patient: What does that mean? doctor: It means that your eustachian tubes, which are the tubes that connect your middle ear to your throat, are not working properly. This is causing fluid to build up in your middle ear, which is leading to infections. The wax accumulation is also contributing to the problem. patient: What can we do about it? doctor: As I mentioned, we're going to do a myringotomy and tube insertion. This will help to drain the fluid from your middle ear and prevent future infections. We're also going to give you antibiotics to treat the current infection. patient: Okay. doctor: I know this is a lot to take in, but I'm here to answer any questions you have. patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate it.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Chronic ear infections and chronic nasal congestion.

"doctor: Good morning, Mrs. patient, I understand you're here today for a follow-up on your hypertension. patient: That's right, doctor. My blood pressure has been going up lately, and I'm worried about it. doctor: I see. Can you tell me more about what you've been experiencing? patient: Well, I've had high blood pressure for about 15 years now. It's been stable for the past 12-15 years on 10 mg of lisinopril. But in August of 2007, I started treatment with doxorubicin and Procrit, and my blood pressure started to go up over 200. My doctor increased my lisinopril to 40 mg daily, and two weeks ago, after I visited the emergency room with high blood pressure, they added metoprolol and HCTZ. doctor: I see. And are you having any other symptoms besides the high blood pressure? patient: No, not really. I feel fine. doctor: That's good to hear. I'm going to examine you now and then we'll talk about some next steps. doctor: (Examines the patient) Your blood pressure today is 182/78. Your lungs are clear, and there's no abdominal bruit. You do have 1+ edema bilaterally. patient: Oh, that's probably from the Procrit. doctor: It's possible. I'm also going to order some lab tests, including a urinalysis, creatinine, and an SMA7. patient: Okay. doctor: (After reviewing the lab results) Your urinalysis shows 1+ proteinuria, and your creatinine is 0.8. Your renal ultrasound showed possible renal artery stenosis and a 2 cm cyst in the left kidney. However, the MRA of the renal arteries was essentially unremarkable, with no suspicion for renal artery stenosis. patient: So, what does that mean? doctor: Well, it means that we can't find a clear-cut etiology for your recent worsening hypertension. The MRA ruled out renal artery stenosis, so I'm thinking that the Procrit initiation and possible fluid retention may be the cause. patient: I see. doctor: I'm going to start you on hydrochlorothiazide 24 mg daily. I'm also going to give you a sample of Tekturna, which may help to lower your systolic blood pressure. I want you to stick with your salt intake and report back to me in 10 days with your blood pressure results.

"doctor: Hello, patient, thank you for coming in today. I understand you've been experiencing shortness of breath, fatigue, and tiredness. Can you tell me more about that? patient: Yes, doctor. I've been feeling short of breath and tired for the past few weeks. I also have chest pain that feels like a dull ache in my chest. It's not related to any specific activity or exertion, and there's nothing that seems to make it better or worse. doctor: I see. Have you had any other symptoms, like lightheadedness, dizziness, or fainting? patient: No, I haven't had any of those symptoms. My activity level has been pretty stable, but I do have a low-grade fever that I've noticed over the past few weeks. doctor: Okay. I'd like to do a few tests to try to figure out what's causing your symptoms. We'll start with a blood test and a chest X-ray. patient: Sure, I'm happy to do that. doctor: (After reviewing the test results) Your blood test shows that you have an elevated white blood cell count, which could be a sign of an infection. Your chest X-ray shows that you have a pericardial effusion, which is a buildup of fluid around your heart. patient: What does that mean? doctor: It means that the sac around your heart is filled with fluid. This can put pressure on your heart and make it difficult to pump blood. In some cases, it can also lead to shortness of breath and chest pain. patient: Is it serious? doctor: It can be, but it depends on the underlying cause. In your case, the effusion appears to be chronic, which means it's been there for a while. We'll need to do some more tests to try to figure out what's causing it. patient: What kind of tests? doctor: We'll start with an echocardiogram, which is an ultrasound of your heart. That will help us get a better look at the effusion and see if it's causing any problems with your heart function. We may also need to do a biopsy of the pericardium, which is the sac around your heart. patient: Okay. I'm a little nervous, but I'll do whatever it takes to get better. doctor: I understand. We'll take good care of you. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe some antibiotics to treat the infection.

He had fairly significant swelling in his penis, scrotum, and suprapubic region. He also had a purulent discharge and a fever of 102 to 103 degrees Fahrenheit. doctor: Okay. And when did you bring him to the hospital? patient's mother: We brought him to the hospital on Thursday. He was transferred to Children's Hospital for further care. doctor: I see. And what have the doctors been doing to treat him? patient's mother: They've been giving him clindamycin, and he's now afebrile and showing marked improvement. doctor: That's good to hear. I was requested to consult on his case because of the appearance of his penis. Can I take a look? patient's mother: Sure. doctor: (Examines patient's penis) Okay. I see that he has a buried appearance of the penis after the recent circumcision, with a normal-appearing glans. The tissue itself is quite dull and soft or readily retractable at this time. The scrotum is normal, and there's no erythema or tenderness. Both testes are descended without hydroceles. doctor: I think that the swelling is a mixture of the resolving cellulitis and a suprapubic fat pad. I'm going to recommend that he be treated with Bactrim for a 10-day course at home, bacitracin, or some antibiotics ointment to the penis with each diaper change for the next 2 to 3 weeks, and sitz baths once or twice a day. patient's mother: Okay. I'll do that. doctor: I also want to talk to you about the importance of gently retracting the skin to keep it from adhering again. Because of the prominent suprapubic fat pad, it's more likely to adhere again. patient's mother: I understand. I'll be sure to do that. doctor: Good. I think that patient is going to be just fine. He has a scheduled follow-up appointment with his urologist. He should keep that appointment or follow up sooner if there are any other problems. patient's mother: Thank you, Dr. doctor. I appreciate your help. doctor: You're welcome. I'm glad I could help.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Swelling and fever after circumcision.
