"doctor: Good morning, Mr. A. Thank you for coming in today. I understand you're here for a new patient evaluation. patient: That's right. doctor: Can you tell me a little bit about your medical history? patient: Well, I've had two surgeries in the past. The first was in July of 2006, and the second was in August of 2007. After that, I started having seizures and hemiparesis. I've been in and out of the hospital, and I developed C. diff. I'm currently in a nursing home because I'm unable to care for myself. doctor: I see. I've reviewed your medical records, including the information from the nursing home. It looks like you're taking Keppra, Decadron, oxycodone, aspirin, Prilosec, Dilantin, and Flagyl. Is that correct? patient: Yes, that's right. doctor: Okay. I've also reviewed your imaging studies. It shows that you have a malignant meningioma with progression of disease and significant brain edema. patient: What does that mean? doctor: It means that the tumor has grown and is causing swelling in your brain. This is causing your symptoms, such as the seizures, hemiparesis, and confusion. patient: So what can be done about it? doctor: Unfortunately, there are no good treatment options for malignant meningioma. Chemotherapy is an option, but you're not in a condition to receive it. Surgery is another option, but I don't think it would be in your best interest. The likelihood of benefit from surgery is small, and there's a good chance that you wouldn't be able to recover. patient: I don't understand. Why wouldn't surgery help? doctor: Because the tumor is so aggressive, it's likely to come back even after surgery. And the surgery itself is very risky. You could end up with more problems than you have now. patient: So what are my options? doctor: I'm afraid there aren't any good options. The best we can do is try to manage your symptoms and make you as comfortable as possible. patient: That's it? There's nothing else that can be done? doctor: I'm sorry, but that's the reality of the situation. patient: (Silence) doctor: I know this is a lot to take in. I'm here to answer any questions you have. patient: (Silence) doctor: I'm going to give you some information about malignant meningioma and the different treatment options. I'll also give you a referral to a palliative care specialist. They can help you manage your symptoms and provide support to you and your family. patient: Thank you. doctor: You're welcome. I'm here if you need anything else.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT New patient evaluation.

"doctor: Hello, Mr./Ms. patient, thank you for coming in today. I understand you're here for complaints of low back and right thigh pain. patient: That's right, doctor. It's been going on for a while now, and it's really starting to affect my daily life. doctor: I see. Can you tell me a little bit more about the pain? Where exactly do you feel it, and how would you describe it? patient: It's mostly in my lower back, between L4 and the sacrum. It's a sharp, stabbing pain that sometimes radiates down my right thigh. It's been especially bad lately, and I've been having trouble sleeping and working. doctor: I understand. Have you seen a doctor about this before? patient: Yes, I was seen in your clinic on 04/12/05. I was prescribed a Medrol Dosepak, and it helped reduce the pain a bit. But it's still there, and it's still interfering with my life. doctor: I see. Well, let's take a look at your back and see if we can find anything that might be causing the pain. The doctor performs a physical examination of the patient's back. doctor: Your range of motion is limited, and you're tender to palpation. There's no overt muscular spasm, and your reflexes are symmetric. patient: So what does that mean? doctor: Well, it means that there's something going on in your back that's causing the pain. It could be a herniated disc, or it could be something else. We'll need to do some more tests to figure it out. patient: What kind of tests? doctor: We'll start with an MRI. That will give us a detailed look at your spine and help us see what's causing the pain. patient: Okay. And what happens after that? doctor: Once we know what's causing the pain, we can start treating it. We may need to prescribe medication, or we may need to do surgery. But we'll take it one step at a time. patient: I'm glad to hear that. I'm ready to do whatever it takes to get rid of this pain. doctor: I'm glad to hear that. We'll work together to get you feeling better. The doctor and patient discuss the patient's medical history, including his previous back surgeries and his current medications. doctor: Okay, Mr./Ms. patient, I've reviewed your medical history and your test results. I've also examined your back. I believe that you have a herniated disc at L4-L5. This is a condition in which the soft, jelly-like center of an intervertebral disc pushes through the tough outer layer of the disc. This can cause pain, numbness, and weakness in the back and legs. patient: So what can we do about it? doctor: There are a few different treatment options for a herniated disc. We can start with conservative treatment, such as physical therapy and pain medication. If that doesn't help, we may need to consider surgery. patient: I'm not sure I want to have surgery. doctor: I understand. Surgery is always a last resort. But if conservative treatment doesn't help, it may be the best option for you. patient: I'll think about it. doctor: Okay. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a new pain medication. I'm also going to refer you to a physical therapist. patient: Thank you, doctor. doctor: You're welcome. I'm here to help.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Low back and right thigh pain.

"doctor: Hello Mrs./Ms. patient, thank you for coming in today. I understand you're here because of some back pain and right leg pain. Can you tell me a little bit more about that? patient: Sure. I've been having back pain and right leg pain for about two years now. It started after I was diagnosed with small cell lung cancer. The cancer has spread to my femurs, lower lumbar spine, and pelvis. doctor: I see. So, the pain started after your cancer diagnosis and has been ongoing since then? patient: Yes, that's right. I've had numerous chemotherapy and radiation treatments, but the pain hasn't gone away. I just finished a series of 10 radiation treatments for pain relief, but it didn't help much. doctor: I understand. Can you describe the pain in more detail? Where exactly do you feel it, and what does it feel like? patient: The pain is mostly in my low back on the right side. It radiates down the back of my right leg to my knee. I also have some numbness in the bottom of my left foot, and some sharp pain in the left foot at times. The pain is sharp, dull, and aching. It's a 10 out of 10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst possible pain. doctor: Okay, and what makes the pain worse or better? patient: It seems to be worse while sitting in the car for a long time, standing, or walking. doctor: I see. And what medications are you taking for the pain? patient: I'm on Duragesic patch 250 mcg total, Celebrex 200 mg once daily, iron 240 mg twice daily, Paxil 20 mg daily, and Percocet.

I'd like to do a physical exam now to get a better understanding of your condition. doctor: (performs physical exam) doctor: Based on my examination and your history, I think you have a symptomatic facet and sacroiliac joint syndrome on the right.

We generally don't perform injections while patients are on warfarin, but since you're on a very small dose and have had previous biopsies while on it without any complications, we should be okay. patient: That sounds good. doctor: I've also asked that you stop taking Paxil and start taking Cymbalta instead. Cymbalta is a medication that can help with both depression and pain. I've also asked for an x-ray of your lumbar spine for further evaluation. patient: Okay, I'll do all of that. doctor: Great.

"doctor: Good morning, Mr. patient, thank you for coming in today. I understand you've been experiencing some heart failure symptoms. Can you tell me more about what you've been feeling? patient: Well, I've been feeling generally okay, but I've been stressed and fatigued. I work hard running three companies, and I've noticed shortness of breath with exertion and occasional shortness of breath at rest. I've also had some PND, but I sleep on one pillow. I don't have any edema now, but I've had some mild leg swelling in the past. I've never had any angina, palpitations, syncope, or near syncope. When I take my pulse, I notice some irregularity. I don't follow any special diet and I don't get regular exercise, although I've recently started walking for half an hour a day. Over the past year, these symptoms have been slowly getting worse. I've also gained about 20 pounds. doctor: I see. Do you have any history of heart failure or other heart problems? patient: No, I don't. doctor: What about your past medical history? Any notable conditions or surgeries? patient: I had a right inguinal hernia repair in 1982 and trauma to my right thumb. I don't have a history of high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, or heart murmur. doctor: Okay. Now, let's talk about your social history. Where do you live, and who do you live with? patient: I live in San Salvador with my wife. I have a lot of stress in my life. I don't smoke, but I do drink. I have a high school education. doctor: And your family history? Any heart conditions or other significant illnesses? patient: My mother is alive at age 89. My father died at 72 of a heart attack. I have two brothers and one sister, all of whom are healthy, although my oldest brother suffered a myocardial infarction. I have three healthy girls and nine healthy grandchildren. doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. I'm going to perform a comprehensive cardiovascular examination now. The doctor performs the examination. doctor: Based on my examination, I've noted a few findings. Your blood pressure is 120/70 in each arm seated, your pulse is 80 beats per minute and regular, and your breathing is 12 times per minute and unlabored. Your heart rhythm is regular, and your first and second heart sounds are normal. However, you do have a fourth heart sound and a soft systolic murmur. Your precordial impulse is enlarged. Your lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion, and your abdomen is soft without hepatosplenomegaly or masses. You don't have any clubbing, cyanosis, or peripheral edema. Your distal pulses are normal throughout both arms and both legs. Neurologically, your mentation, mood, and affect are normal, and you're oriented to person, place, and time. doctor: I've also reviewed your test results. Your EKG shows sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy, and your metabolic stress test indicates mild cardiopulmonary disease. Your laboratory data shows normal TSH, glucose, creatinine, potassium, and hematocrit. Your urinalysis was also normal. I've also reviewed your echocardiogram, which shows a dilated cardiomyopathy with an EF of 15% and a left ventricular diastolic dimension of 6.8 cm. There are no significant valvular abnormalities. Your stress thallium showed no scintigraphic evidence of stress-induced myocardial ischemia, but there is a fixed small-sized mild-to-moderate intensity perfusion defect in the distal inferior wall and apex, which may be an old infarct. doctor: Based on all of this information, it appears that you have a newly diagnosed dilated cardiomyopathy. The etiology of this is uncertain, but there is a strong genetic component. We'll need to do some family screening to make sure your siblings and children haven't developed the same condition. patient: What does this mean for me? doctor: Well, we'll need to start you on some medications to help manage your condition. I'm going to prescribe an ACE inhibitor, lisinopril, and a beta-blocker, carvedilol. We'll start with low doses and gradually increase them over the next few weeks. I'll also recommend that you start taking a loop diuretic, such as furosemide, to help reduce fluid retention. In addition, you should make some lifestyle changes, such as eating a healthy diet, getting regular exercise, and managing your stress. patient: I'll do whatever it takes to get better. doctor: I'm confident that we can help you manage your condition and improve your quality of life. I'll see you again in 3 to 6 months to check on your progress.

"doctor: Hello, Mr. Smith, it's good to see you again. How have you been doing since your last visit? patient: I've been doing quite well, doctor. I've had no symptoms of CAD or CHF. I followed up with Dr. X, and she thought I was doing well too. I've had no symptoms of high or low blood sugar. I haven't had any falls either. My right knee does pain me sometimes, though. I've been taking Tylenol for that. doctor: I see. And how is your memory and thinking? patient: My memory is clear, and my thinking is good. doctor: That's good to hear. Now, let's talk about your medications. You're still taking Bumex, aspirin, lisinopril, NPH insulin, Zocor, Toprol-XL, and Protonix, correct? patient: Yes, that's right. doctor: Okay. I'm going to have the nurse take your blood pressure and pulse. nurse takes blood pressure and pulse doctor: Your blood pressure is 140/78 and your pulse is 91 and regular. Your oxygen saturation is 94%. Your JVP is normal without HJR. Your lungs are clear to auscultation. Your heart sounds are S1 and S2 with an unchanged aortic murmur.

You were able to get up on to the examination table and out of a chair with normal gait. You have bilateral OA changes of the knee. patient: Yes, my right knee has been bothering me. doctor: I see. Well, your creatinine is down to 1.7, which is an improvement from your last visit when it was 2.3. Your A1c is also improved, down to 7.6 from 8.5. Your total cholesterol is 192, your HDL is 37, and your triglycerides are 487. patient: What do you think about my triglycerides? doctor: Well, at your last visit, you had 3+ protein in your urine. Your TSH was normal. We're going to get a 24-hour urine to rule out nephrosis as the cause of your hypertriglyceridemia. In the meantime, Dr. X and I have been considering whether you should have an agent added to treat your hypertriglyceridemia. Specifically, we were considering TriCor (fenofibrate). However, given your history of high CPK values, we've decided not to do that for now. We'll leave that option open for the future. We'll also check a fasting lipid panel today. patient: Okay. doctor: Now, let's talk about your arthritis. You can use Extra Strength Tylenol up to 4 grams a day, but I suggest that you start with a regular dose of 1 to 2 to 3 grams per day. You can increase the dose gradually if needed. As for a brace, you mentioned that you've used one in the past and it didn't help much. I'm a little concerned about the tourniquet effect of a brace, which could increase your edema or put you at risk for venous thromboembolic disease. So, for now, you should continue using your cane and walker. patient: I'll do that. doctor: Finally, I'm going to give you a flu vaccination today. patient: Thank you. doctor: You're welcome. I'd like to see you back in 3 months. If you have any problems before then, please don't hesitate to call the office. patient: I will. Thank you, doctor.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Right knee pain.

"doctor: Good morning, patient. Thank you for coming in today. I understand you're here for a second opinion on your kyphosis. patient: That's right. I've been noticing a round back posture for a while now, and my parents took me to another orthopedist who recommended observation. I wanted to get a second opinion to see if there are any other treatment options. doctor: I see. Well, let's start with a few questions. Are you experiencing any pain in your back or any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your upper or lower extremities? patient: No, I don't have any pain or numbness. doctor: Okay.

Your X-rays also showed a 46-degree kyphosis. patient: So, what does this mean? doctor: Well, kyphosis is a condition where the spine curves abnormally forward. In your case, the curve is mild and is likely within the normal range for an adolescent. However, we'll need to monitor it closely to make sure it doesn't progress. patient: What are my treatment options? doctor: There are three main options: observation, physical therapy, and bracing. Since your kyphosis is mild and you're still growing, we can start with observation and physical therapy. The physical therapy will focus on extension-based strengthening exercises, flexibility range of motion exercises, and postural training. We'll see you back in 3 months for repeat radiographs to assess your progress.

"doctor: Good morning, patient. I understand you're here for a second opinion regarding cataract extraction. patient: Yes, that's right. I've been told that I need cataract surgery in both eyes, but I'm nervous about having surgery. doctor: I can understand your concerns. Cataract surgery is a major surgery, and it's natural to be nervous. I'm here to answer any questions you have and help you make the best decision for your eyes. patient: Well, I've had laser surgery four times to the macula in my right eye and twice in my left eye. I see Dr. X for that. doctor: I see. Dr. X is a very good ophthalmologist. I'm sure he's given you excellent care. patient: He has. But I'm still worried about cataract surgery. I'm afraid it will make my vision worse. doctor: I can understand your concerns. However, I want to assure you that cataract surgery is a very safe and effective procedure. In most cases, it can significantly improve vision. patient: Really? doctor: Yes. Cataracts are a clouding of the lens of the eye. They can cause blurry vision, glare, and difficulty seeing at night. Cataract surgery removes the cloudy lens and replaces it with a clear artificial lens. This can often restore vision to near-normal levels. patient: That's encouraging. But what about my macular degeneration? doctor: Macular degeneration is a serious condition that can lead to vision loss. However, cataract surgery can actually help to slow the progression of macular degeneration. By removing the cataracts, we can improve the clarity of the images that reach the macula. This can help to preserve vision and prevent further damage. patient: That's good to know. I think I'm starting to feel a little better about cataract surgery. doctor: I'm glad to hear that. I know it's a big decision, but I'm confident that cataract surgery is the right choice for you. patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help. doctor: You're welcome.

Well, Mrs. Patient, based on your symptoms and medical history, I think it's likely that you're experiencing angina pectoris. This is a condition in which the blood flow to your heart is reduced, causing chest pain. Patient: What causes angina pectoris? Doctor: There are a number of things that can cause angina pectoris, including coronary artery disease, which is a narrowing of the arteries that supply blood to your heart. Smoking, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure are all risk factors for coronary artery disease. Patient: So, what can I do to treat my angina? Doctor: There are a number of things we can do. First, we need to get your risk factors under control. This means quitting smoking, lowering your cholesterol, and managing your blood pressure. We may also prescribe medication to help improve blood flow to your heart and reduce chest pain. Patient: Okay, I'll do whatever it takes to get better. Doctor: I'm glad to hear that.

"doctor: Good afternoon, Mr. ABC. I'm Dr. doctor, and I'll be your cardiologist today. I understand you've been experiencing some chest pain. patient: Yes, that's right. I've been having chest pain for the past few weeks. It started out as a mild pain, but it's gotten worse over time. Now, it's severe and it comes on after just a few minutes of exercise. doctor: I see. And have you been experiencing any other symptoms, such as shortness of breath or lightheadedness? patient: No, not really. Just the chest pain. doctor: Okay. Well, I'd like to run a few tests to try to figure out what's causing your chest pain. We'll start with a stress test. patient: Sure. doctor: (After the stress test) Well, Mr. ABC, the stress test showed that you have severe chest pain after just 5 minutes of exercise. We also saw some horizontal ST depressions and moderate apical ischemia on the stress imaging. patient: What does that mean? doctor: It means that there's a blockage in your arteries that's preventing blood from flowing properly to your heart. This can cause chest pain and other symptoms. patient: Is it serious? doctor: It can be. If the blockage is severe, it can lead to a heart attack. That's why I'm recommending that we do a cardiac catheterization. patient: What's that? doctor: It's a procedure where we insert a thin tube into your artery and inject a dye that will help us see the blockage. patient: Okay. doctor: (After the cardiac catheterization) Well, Mr. ABC, the cardiac catheterization showed that you have mild-to-moderate left main distal disease, moderate proximal LAD with a severe mid-LAD lesion, and a mid-left circumflex lesion. patient: What does that mean? doctor: It means that you have a blockage in several of your arteries. The blockage in your left anterior descending artery is the most severe. This is the artery that supplies blood to the front of your heart. patient: So, what do we do now? doctor: I'm recommending that we transfer you to Medical Center for PCI. PCI is a procedure where we insert a stent into the artery to open up the blockage. patient: Okay. I'm agreeable with that. doctor: I've already spoken with Dr. X at Medical Center, and he has kindly accepted you in transfer.

Can you tell me how you've been doing since we last saw you? patient: Well, things have gotten worse. My walking and balance are much worse. I can barely walk at all now. I need a walker and help from an assistant just to stand or walk. doctor: I see. And how about your incontinence? patient: It's the same. I don't feel the need to go to the bathroom, but when I'm asked, I can tell I need to go. I wear a Depends undergarment all the time. doctor: Okay. And how is your thinking and memory? patient: They're worse too. I'm mostly apathetic. I don't talk much. I live in a skilled nursing facility in the Alzheimer's section. I do have some daytime activities and I take a nap once a day, but I don't read much anymore. doctor: I see. That's concerning. I'd like to examine you today and see if there are any changes since your last visit. doctor: (Examines the patient) Okay, Mr. patient, I've reviewed your medical history and examined you today. I'm concerned about the worsening of your gait, dementia, and incontinence. I've also noticed a new finding today, which is limited upgaze. This could be consistent with either progressive supranuclear palsy or progressive enlargement of the ventricles. patient: (Wife and daughter look at each other with concern) What does that mean? doctor: Well, it means that we need to consider all the possible causes of your symptoms and determine the best course of treatment. One option is to try a trial of CSF drainage via spinal catheter again. This is a procedure where we insert a thin tube into your spinal canal to drain excess cerebrospinal fluid. We did this over a year ago at Hospital, but it didn't seem to help at the time. However, your ventricles appear to be larger now than they were a year ago, so it's possible that hydrocephalus is still contributing to your symptoms. wife: (Hesitantly) So, you're saying that there's a chance that surgery could help? doctor: Yes, that's right. But it's important to understand that there is no guarantee. The success of shunt surgery depends on many factors, including the underlying cause of your symptoms. daughter: (With a sigh) I guess we have a lot to think about. doctor: I understand. I've given you a printed prescription of the protocol including its rationale, risks, benefits, and alternatives.

The patient presents with worsening gait, dementia, and incontinence. He states that he has a walker and help from an assistant just to stand or walk. He is mostly apathetic and does not talk much anymore. He wears Depends undergarment all the time, but when he's asked to go to the bathroom, he can tell he needs to go. He has limited upgaze, which is a new finding today, which could be consistent with progressive supranuclear palsy or progressive enlargement of the ventricles. He does not have any new findings today, but is concerned about the worsening of his gait and dementia, which may be related to his deteriorating gait. He lives in a skilled nursing facility in the Alzheimer's section. He takes a nap once a day, but doesn't read much anymore, but he does have some daytime activities and he does take a nap at night. His thinking and memory are worse too. He no longer has the ability to talk much. He also has a problem with his urine leakage, which he can't feel when he has to go potty, but can tell when he is asked to use the bathroom. His urine leakage is very painful and he wears a Depends to relieve himself. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. SHUTT SURGait: The patient's gait has worsened significantly since his last visit. He can barely walk at all now. His balance and balance are much worse. His gait is much worse and his memory is worse. He still has the need to use his walker, but it is much more difficult for him to use it now. 2. Dementia: His memory and thinking are worse. I don't talk much at all. I do have some nighttime activities and I take a naps, but do not read much. 3. Accumulation of CSF drainage via spinal catheter again. This is a procedure where we insert a thin tube into your spinal canal to drain excess cerebrospinal fluid. We did this over a year ago at Hospital and it didn't seem to help at the time. However, your ventricle appear to be larger now than they were over the year ago, so it's possible that hydrocephus is still contributing to"

He also reports that he has a history of neck pain for about 30 years. He has been getting epidural injections for it since 2007. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. Right Arm pain history Assessment: The patient reports that his right upper arm pain has been intermittent, but it's still a constant nagging pain. The patient's reflexes are all normal, and his sensation is intact. His gait and stance are also normal. His reflexes, stance, and reflex reflexes have not changed significantly since the pain began. He currently takes Medrol and Neurontin for pain management. Plan: - Schedule an EMG and nerve conduction studies to see if there is any evidence of nerve damage, although I think the likelihood is low. - Schedule a prescription for Neuronontin. - Plan to discuss the side effects of the medication tomorrow at Spine Conference. - Follow up with the patient at Spinal Conference to discuss if there are any further recommendations. 2. Head pain Assessment: Patient reports neck pain history since 2007, and has also been taking Medrol, Medrol packs, and Medrol doses packs, but has also caused blood sugar levels to rise, which has caused the patient's blood sugar level to increase, which is causing the patient to have a high blood sugar, which may be related to the increased blood sugar. Plan (1) Assessment: - The patient has neck pain, and the patient has been taking several Medrol pack packs. - The blood sugar may be due to the blood sugar being raised, which could cause the pain to worsen. - Patient is on Medrol. - He may also take Medrol or Medrol dosages packs, such as the Medrols, which can cause blood sugar and blood sugar issues. Plan 2: - Follow-up with the Patient Conference to determine if further recommendations are made. - Continue"
"Doctor: Hello, patient, I understand you're here today because of some allergy problems? Patient: Yes, that's right. I used to have allergies when I lived in Seattle, but they seem to be worse here.

Doctor: How long have you been experiencing these symptoms? Patient: For about two weeks now. Doctor: Have you tried any medications to relieve your symptoms? Patient: Yes, I've tried Claritin, Zyrtec, and Allegra. They all worked for a short time, but then they seemed to stop working. Doctor: I see. Have you tried any over-the-counter nasal sprays? Patient: No, I haven't. Doctor: Okay. Well, I think you have allergic rhinitis. This is a common condition that causes inflammation of the nasal passages. It's usually caused by an allergy to something in the environment, such as pollen, dust, or pet dander. Patient: I see. So, what can I do to treat it? Doctor: There are a few things you can do. First, you can try taking Zyrtec again. It's a different type of antihistamine than Claritin and Allegra, so it might work better for you. You can also try using loratadine.

They also did a CT of my head and ruled out any acute intracranial pathology. But my ammonia levels were found to be markedly elevated at 106, so I'm being admitted for management of that. doctor: Okay, I understand. Have you been having any other symptoms besides the fall and the head injury? patient: No, I haven't had any abdominal pain, change in bowel habits, GI bleed, hematemesis, melena, or hematochezia.

"doctor: Good morning, Mr. patient, I understand you're here today for left knee pain. Can you tell me more about what's been going on? patient: Sure, doctor.

Can you please lie down on the exam table? patient: Sure. doctor: (Examines the patient's knee) I'm seeing some swelling and tenderness around your knee joint.

Can you try bending and straightening your knee for me? patient: (Attempts to bend and straighten knee) It hurts when I do that. doctor: Okay, that's understandable. I'm also going to test your strength. Can you try pushing against my hand with your knee? patient: (Attempts to push against doctor's hand) It's weak. doctor: Okay, I've got a good understanding of your condition.

"doctor: Hello, patient's parents. Thank you for bringing patient in today. I understand he's been having some rectal bleeding. Can you tell me more about what you've been seeing? patient's parent: Yes, it started about 2 days ago. He had a hard stool with bright red blood in it. Then, he had another episode yesterday and one again this morning, but this time the stool was soft and had dark red blood in it. doctor: Okay, and has he had any other symptoms, like fever, diarrhea, or easy bruising? patient's parent: No, he hasn't had any of those. doctor: I see. And how has his appetite been? patient's parent: He's been eating regular table food and drinking 24 ounces of milk a day. doctor: Okay, that's good. Now, I'm going to examine patient and then we'll talk about some tests that we can do to figure out what's causing the bleeding. The doctor examines patient. doctor: Patient's vital signs are all within normal limits. He's alert and active, and his abdomen is soft and nondistended. I didn't feel any masses when I palpated his abdomen. His rectal exam was deferred, but there were no perianal lesions. doctor: Based on patient's symptoms and my examination, I think there are a few possible causes for the bleeding. One possibility is a Meckel's diverticulum, which is a small pouch that can form in the small intestine. Another possibility is a polyp, which is a small growth that can grow in the colon or rectum. We also need to consider an infection or a vascular malformation. doctor: To help us figure out what's causing the bleeding, I'd like to order a Meckel scan today. If the Meckel scan is negative, we'll consider doing an upper endoscopy and a colonoscopy. We'll also start a colon clean out if the Meckel scan is negative. doctor: In addition, I'd like to send his stool for a C. diff toxin test and culture. I'd also like to order a blood test for a RAST test for cow's milk, soy, wheat, and egg allergies. doctor: We'll also monitor his hemoglobin levels. patient's parent: Okay, I understand. Thank you for explaining everything. doctor: You're welcome. I'll be back in a little while to check on patient and answer any other questions you may have.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Rectal bleeding.

"doctor: Hello, patient, I'm doctor, the surgeon who will be evaluating you today. I understand you've been referred to me for a thyroid mass that was recently diagnosed as papillary carcinoma. Can you tell me a little bit more about your symptoms? patient: Sure. I first noticed a small lump in my thyroid about a year ago. It didn't bother me at first, but it started to get bigger recently. I went to the Pediatric Endocrinology Department, and they did a fine needle aspiration biopsy, which confirmed it was papillary thyroid carcinoma. doctor: I see. Have you experienced any other symptoms, such as hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, or weight changes? patient: No, I haven't had any of those symptoms. My weight has been stable, and I don't have any trouble swallowing or speaking. doctor: That's good to hear. Do you have any family history of thyroid cancer or other endocrine disorders? patient: Not that I know of. My father mentioned that his mother had thyroid surgery, but he's not sure if it was for cancer or goiter. doctor: Okay. I'll make a note of that. Now, let's take a closer look at your neck. (The doctor performs a physical examination of the patient's neck.) doctor: I can feel a slightly visible midline bulge in the region of the thyroid isthmus. There's also a firm nodule there, and some nodularity in the right lobe of the thyroid. The mass is relatively hard and slightly fixed, but it doesn't seem to be tethered to the surrounding tissues, skin, or muscles. I also noticed some shotty adenopathy in the area, but no supraclavicular nodes. patient: Does that mean the cancer has spread? doctor: It's possible, but we can't be sure until we do some further testing. I'd like to order a chest x-ray and review your laboratory data from the Diagnostics Lab. patient: Okay. (The doctor orders the tests and reviews the patient's medical history.) doctor: I see that you have a mild abnormality in your AST levels, but your T4, TSH, and free thyroxine levels are all normal. Your serum pregnancy test is also negative. Unfortunately, there's no level of thyroglobulin recorded on this. patient: What does all that mean? doctor: Well, the AST abnormality is not a major concern, but it's something we'll want to keep an eye on. The normal T4, TSH, and free thyroxine levels indicate that your thyroid is still functioning properly. The negative pregnancy test is important because we can't use radioactive iodine therapy if you're pregnant. And the thyroglobulin level is a marker for thyroid cancer, so we'll need to get that checked as soon as possible. patient: I see. doctor: Now, let's talk about the chest x-ray. The radiologist noted a diffuse pattern of tiny nodules in both lungs, which is typical of miliary metastatic disease that is often seen in patients with metastatic thyroid carcinoma. This is unfortunate because it generally means a more advanced stage of disease. patient: (Visibly upset) Oh no. Does that mean the cancer has spread to my lungs? doctor: It's possible, but we can't be sure until we do a biopsy. I'll need to discuss this with the oncology team and see what they recommend. (The doctor spends the next 30 minutes discussing the surgical aspects of the treatment with the patient and her family.) doctor: I recommend performing a total thyroidectomy to remove the primary source of the cancer and eradicate as much of the native thyroid tissue as possible. We'll also do a sentinel node dissection to check for the spread of cancer to the lymph nodes. patient: What are the risks of surgery? doctor: There are a few potential risks, including damage to the recurrent laryngeal and external laryngeal branches of the nerve supplying the vocal cord function, which could lead to hoarseness or difficulty speaking. There's also a risk of hypoparathyroidism if all four of the parathyroid glands are damaged during the operation, which could lead to low calcium levels and other complications. patient: That's a lot to take in. doctor: I understand. This is a lot to process, and I'm here to answer any questions you have. (The doctor and the patient's family continue to discuss the surgery and the potential risks and benefits.) doctor: I've made every effort to get you scheduled for surgery within the next 48 hours. We're tentatively planning on proceeding this upcoming Friday afternoon with total thyroidectomy. In the meantime, I'll order the necessary tests and consult with the oncology team to discuss the best course of treatment. patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help. doctor: You're welcome. I'll see you again before the surgery to answer any additional questions you may have.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Thyroid mass evaluation.

There is also some shotty adenopathy in the area. Chest x-ray showed a diffuse pattern of tiny nodules in both lungs, which is typical of miliary metastatic disease. Plan: - Will schedule a total thyroidectomy and sentinel node dissection within the next 48 hours. - Will consult with the oncology team to discuss the best course of treatment. - Will obtain thyroglobulin level. 2. AST abnormality Assessment: Mild abnormality in AST levels. Plan: - Will monitor AST levels. 3. Metastatic thyroid carcinoma Assessment: Diffuse pattern of tiny nodules in both lungs on chest x-ray, suggestive of metastatic thyroid carcinoma. Plan: - Will discuss with oncology team regarding further evaluation and management. 4. Risk of hypocalcemia Assessment: Potential risk of hypoparathyroidism if all four of the parathyroid glands are damaged during the operation. Plan: - Will monitor calcium levels postoperatively. 5. Risk of vocal cord dysfunction Assessment: Potential risk of damage to the recurrent laryngeal and external laryngeal branches of the nerve supplying the vocal cord function during surgery. Plan: - Will monitor vocal cord function postoperatively. Follow-up instructions: - The patient will be seen again before the surgery to answer any additional questions. - The patient will follow up with the oncology team after surgery to discuss further treatment options.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Thyroid cancer. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a pleasant age-year-old male who presents to the clinic for evaluation of thyroid cancer. He reports that he first noticed a small lump in his thyroid about a year ago. The mass is relatively hard and slightly fixed, but it doesn't seem to be tethered to the surrounding tissues, skin, or muscles. He also noticed some shotty adenopathy in the area, but no supraclavicular nodes. The patient has no symptoms of hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, or weight changes. His weight has been stable, and he doesn't have any trouble swallowing or speaking. He has no history of thyroid disease or other endocrine disorders. His father mentioned that his mother had thyroid surgery, but he's not sure if it was for cancer or goiter. He is not aware of any family history of the disease. His family history is normal, but the patient has a mild abnormality in his AST levels, but his T4, TSH, and free thyroxine levels are all normal. His TSH is also normal, and his TSH levels are not elevated. His serum pregnancy test is also negative. The negative pregnancy test indicates that he is not pregnant. The normal T4 and TSH are a marker for thyroid cancer, so it's something we'll want to keep an eye on. He will also do a sentinel node dissection to check for the spread of cancer to the lymph nodes. He plans to order a chest x-ray and review his laboratory data from the Diagnostics Lab. (The patient's medical history: He has a history of endocrine disease and other symptoms, including hypoparathyroidism, hypo para thyroid ism, parathyroid glands, hyposplenia, and hypo-parathyroidus. His thyroid is still functioning properly. He does not have any other symptoms associated with the disease, such as hoarsness or difficulty swallowing or difficulty speaking. His laryngeal and external larynceal branches of the nerve supplying the vocal cord function, which could lead to the loss of speech. His blood pressure is normal and his blood glucose levels are normal. He's also not concerned about the presence of cancer in his lungs. His test results are negative for thyroglobulin, AST, or free thyrosine levels. He currently has a positive pregnancy test. His laboratory data"

"doctor: Hello, patient. Thank you for coming in today. I understand you've been experiencing some unusual spells recently. Can you tell me more about what's been happening? patient (father): Sure. Patient's name has been having these brief periods where she pauses and stares. She becomes unresponsive, but she doesn't lose her balance or fall. doctor: How long do these spells typically last? patient (mother): They vary. I've seen them last anywhere from 10 to 15 seconds, but patient's father says they can last up to 3 or 4 minutes. doctor: I see. Have you noticed anything else unusual during these spells, like any changes in her breathing or skin color? patient (mother): Yes, actually. During one of the spells outside a store recently, her lips turned blue for a few seconds. But she's never had any convulsions or shaking. doctor: That's important information. Now, I'd like to ask you a few questions about patient's name's medical history. She has a history of febrile seizures, correct? patient (father): Yes, that's right. She's been taking Keppra to prevent them, and it's been working well. doctor: I see. Has there been any change in her Keppra dosage recently? patient (mother): No, she's still taking the same dose, 150 mg twice a day. doctor: Okay. I'd like to perform a physical examination to gather more information. If that's alright with you. patient (parents): Sure, go ahead. doctor: (Conducts physical examination) doctor: Based on your symptoms and examination findings, I believe patient's name may be experiencing partial complex seizures or possibly nonconvulsive generalized seizures. We'll need to do an EEG to confirm the diagnosis. patient (father): What's an EEG? doctor: An EEG is a test that records the electrical activity in the brain. It can help us identify any abnormal patterns that may be causing the seizures. patient (mother): Will patient's name need to be sedated for the EEG? doctor: It depends. If she tolerates the procedure well, we may not need to sedate her. However, if she becomes agitated or uncomfortable, we may need to give her a mild sedative to help her relax. patient (father): Okay. What are the next steps? doctor: First, we'll try to capture an EEG as long as patient's name tolerates it. If sedation is needed, we'll defer the EEG until we adjust her seizure medications and see how she responds. I'm also increasing her Keppra dosage to 300 mg twice a day, bringing her total daily dose to just under 40 mg/kg per day. We may increase it further if the spells continue. patient (mother): When will we know the results of the EEG? doctor: I hope to review the findings first thing tomorrow morning. However, I won't delay discharging patient's name to wait for the results. We'll contact you as outpatients once we have them. patient (father): And when should we follow up with you? doctor: I'd like to see patient's name again in 5 to 6 weeks to check on her progress and schedule further follow-up appointments as needed. patient (parents): Thank you, doctor.

milligrams twice a day and flexeril ten milligrams twice a day as well i'm gon na refer you to for for physical therapy to help strengthen some of the muscles in your lower back i do n't think you

"doctor: Good morning, patient. I'm Dr. doctor, and I'll be your physician today. I understand you've been experiencing some health issues lately. Can you tell me a little bit about what's been going on? patient: Sure, doctor. It all started a few months ago when I noticed swelling and discomfort in my left testicle. It's been painful off and on ever since. Then, in November, I started having pain in my upper right leg. I thought it was from skateboarding, but it didn't go away. doctor: I see. And when did you start feeling more fatigued? patient: In December, I noticed I was getting tired more easily. I used to work out regularly, but I didn't have the energy anymore. I've also lost 10 pounds since then, and my appetite has decreased. doctor: That's concerning. Did you experience any other symptoms? patient: Yes, I had night sweats and a cough in December. I was treated with Augmentin, but they didn't go away. I also started taking Accutane for acne in December, but I stopped on February 19th. doctor: I see. Now, let's talk about the more recent events. You mentioned you had severe pain in your right groin and lower quadrant on February 19th. What happened then? patient: I woke up with severe pain and went to the emergency room. They found an elevated white blood cell count and did a CT scan of my abdomen. The scan showed a large clot in my inferior vena cava extending to my right iliac and femoral veins. doctor: That sounds serious. What happened next? patient: I underwent angioplasty, placement of a vena caval filter, and mechanical and pharmacologic thrombolysis. A repeat ultrasound on February 20th showed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis. doctor: That's good news. So, you're currently taking Lovenox, Coumadin, Protonix, Vicodin, and Levaquin. Are there any allergies or past surgeries I should be aware of? patient: No known drug allergies, but I do seem to react to certain adhesives. As for past surgeries, I had the thrombosis treatment on February 19th and 20th. doctor: Okay, I've made a note of that. Now, let's discuss your family history. Do you have any relatives with medical conditions? patient: My maternal great-grandmother had deep venous thrombosis in her 40s, and my maternal great-uncle developed leukemia around age 50. My paternal grandfather died of colon cancer at age 73, and adult-onset diabetes runs in both sides of my family. doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. I'll make sure to document it in your medical record. Now, let's move on to your social history. You mentioned you're a student at the University of Denver. What are your living arrangements like? patient: I live in a dorm on campus. My parents live in Breckenridge. I admit to occasionally smoking marijuana and drinking beer with friends. doctor: I understand. Now, let's talk about your current symptoms. You mentioned nausea and constipation related to Vicodin and pain medication. You also have mild to moderate acne. Do you have any other symptoms, like shortness of breath, chest pain, headaches, joint pains, rashes, or extremity pain? patient: No, I don't have any of those symptoms, except for the right leg pain. doctor: That's good to hear. I've reviewed your physical examination results, and I'd like to order some tests to further assess your condition. We'll do a diagnostic bone marrow aspirate/biopsy and lumbar puncture. We'll also do a Doppler study to reassess the status of the deep venous thrombosis and an ultrasound/Doppler of the testicles. patient: Okay, doctor. I'll cooperate with the tests. doctor: That's great. We'll proceed with the diagnostic procedures as soon as it's safe to do so, considering your anticoagulation status.

Do you wear glasses or contact lenses? patient: I used to wear glasses for astigmatism, but I haven't worn them in the last few years. doctor: Okay. I'm going to take a look at your eyes and see if I can find anything that might be causing your vision problems. doctor: (Examines Mr. ABC's eyes) Your visual acuity is 20/20 in your right eye and 20/40 in your left eye. Your near vision is J2 in both eyes. Your pupils are equal and reactive to light. Your extraocular movements are normal. Your intraocular pressure is 16 mmHg in your right eye and 18 mmHg in your left eye. patient: What does all that mean? doctor: Well, your visual acuity is a measure of how well you can see objects at different distances. Your near vision is how well you can see objects up close. Your pupils are the black circles in the center of your eyes. They get bigger or smaller to let more or less light into your eyes. Your extraocular movements are how well your eyes can move in different directions. Your intraocular pressure is the pressure inside your eyes. patient: Okay.

This is a condition that affects the macula, which is the part of your retina that is responsible for central vision. I also see some signs of glaucoma suspect in both eyes. This is a condition that can damage the optic nerve, which is responsible for sending signals from your eyes to your brain. patient: What can we do about it? doctor: Well, for the age-related macular degeneration, I'm going to recommend that you start taking Ocuvite PreserVision capulets twice a day. This is a supplement that can help to slow the progression of the disease. For the glaucoma suspect, I'm going to order a Humphrey visual field test and some disc photographs.

boot for about six weeks i first noticed it when i put on a pair of shoes that were little bit too tight i felt some burning and some stinging and looked down and saw a blister i did n't think too much of it because it was on the pad of the bottom of my foot around my heel and i just had been walking on the front part of my foot i started to notice a foul smell and my wife mentioned something to me the other day and i noticed my dog was also smelling my socks a lot and so we looked and saw that the blister had become unroofed or the the top part of the skin of the blister became undone and then underneath it was just this really thick soft mushy skin that had a bad smell with some yellow drainage and so and barbara called the primary care doctor who then got me in to see you he started me on some antibiotics about six days ago and i never had any nausea or vomiting but my wife checked my temperature it was about ninety nine point seven and then at one point i had to put on an extra blanket in bed because i had some chills and when i started the antibiotics it started to feel pretty good but we've now noticed that it has turned black around the outside of the wound and i'm getting some cramping in my calf muscle as well and so there was a red streak also that was coming up the front part of my my ankle along the inside portion of my calf muscle and it's super super hot and so they wanted me to take a have have you look at it doctor okay thank you for sharing that history with me and did you complete that course of antibiotics patient i think he called in ten days' worth and i'm on day six or seven right now i know i've got about two or three days left doctor okay and you mentioned that it had some stinging and it was a bit uncomfortable are you experiencing any pain right now patient yeah it was it was stinging initially like i had just done something small but at this point it's it's really like throbbing it's almost like there is a fire poker in the bottom of my foot now and then the inside of my calf muscle is really hard and i've noticed that every time that i push that i feel it all the way up to my knee behind my kneecap and then noticed that i've been coughing a lot the last two days and then i've noticed that i've had like difficult time catching my breath when i'm walking around the house and so it's almost like two different things going on at this point doctor okay so now i see here in your record that you have some that you're diabetic and have some diabetic neuropathy as well how's your blood sugars been running i'm i'm assuming kind of all over the place over the last i'm gon na say probably three or four weeks can you tell me about that patient yeah my my a1c is six point seven it's pretty well controlled doctor okay patient i used to be on an insulin pump and i had an a1c that at one point was like thirteen but we worked with an endocrinologist to get it down to where it's at now i've been six point seven for probably two years now and i rarely have a blood sugar that goes over two hundred i check two or three times a day if i feel weird i'll check it again but i noticed my sugars have probably been trending in the three to four hundreds the last two weeks and then i had one spike at one point at like five or six hundred that got our attention and i think that's also what made my wife call the primary care doc doctor okay now i know this was caused by a new pair of shoes you had mentioned before to your pcp and he relayed this to me that you really like to go on hikes you and your wife have been hiking have you gone to the new trails that that were just opened up here behind the park patient yeah we actually hiked to charlie's bunion about a week before this i've had a new pair of diabetic shoes and inserts i get those every year i changed the inserts every three or four months i mean i've been in cruise control as far as that goes for some time i did get a new pair of shoes the prosthetist told me to check my feet every day for the first week or two which we did i did go hiking about the third or fourth day and i think that might be what caused it as i just went too far when we were hiking but yeah the trails are the trails are gorgeous they're open it's time to to be outside and i'm sorta stuck with this right now doctor absolutely yeah my wife and i like to go back there and and hike those trails as well so i'm gon na do a quick physical exam for your vital signs i do recognize a slight fever however your vitals themselves look good now on your foot exam i do recognize the necrotic wound on your heel as you mentioned it is present it's approximately two by two centimeters i i do recognize the sloughing of the of the tissue as well as what looks like cellulitis around

palpable pulses femorally and popliteal pulses are present however i do n't recognize a palpable pulse dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial however i did use the doppler and they are present via doppler now i'm gon na press on the actual affected area of the wound do you have any pain there patient i do n't feel that right there doctor okay i'm gon na review the results of your right foot x-ray that

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a pleasant age-year-old male who presents today for evaluation of a non-healing foot ulcer on his right foot. The patient reports the onset of symptoms approximately 6 weeks ago when he noted a blister on the pad of the bottom of his foot, around his heel. He initially did not think much of it and continued to walk on the front part of his foot. He eventually noticed a foul smell and his wife also noticed it, as well as the dog smelling his socks a lot. He looked at the blister and noted that the top part of the skin had come off, revealing thick, soft, mushy skin with a bad smell and yellow drainage. His primary care doctor started him on antibiotics 6 days ago, which initially made him feel better, but he has since noticed that the wound has turned black around the outside and he is experiencing cramping in his calf muscle. He also noted a red streak coming up the front part of his ankle along the inside portion of his calf muscle, which is very hot. He denies nausea or vomiting, but he did have a low-grade fever and chills at one point. He also reports a new onset of cough and shortness of breath over the past 2 days. The patient has a history of diabetes and diabetic neuropathy. His A1c is 6.7, which has been well-controlled for the past 2 years.

"doctor: Good morning, patient. I understand you're here for a dietary consultation during your pregnancy due to gestational diabetes. patient: Yes, that's right. I had gestational diabetes with my first pregnancy and had to use insulin. I'm not really sure what ketones are. doctor: I see. Well, ketones are a type of acid that can build up in your blood when you don't have enough insulin or when your blood sugar is too high. This can be dangerous for you and your baby, so it's important to manage your blood sugar levels carefully. patient: Okay. I'll try my best. I've been walking my daughter to school and back home each day, which takes about 40 minutes total. I'm not a big milk drinker, but I do try to drink some. doctor: That's great! Exercise and a healthy diet are both important for managing gestational diabetes. I'm glad to hear you're making an effort to stay active. doctor: Let's take a look at your blood sugar records from the last week. Your fasting blood sugars have been ranging from 92 to 104, with an average of 97. Your two-hour postprandial breakfast readings have been ranging from 172 to 196, with an average of 181. Your two-hour postprandial lunch readings have been ranging from 149 to 189, with an average of 168. And your two-hour postprandial dinner readings have been ranging from 109 to 121, with an average of 116. Your overall average is 140. patient: That's a lot of numbers. What does it all mean? doctor: Well, your blood sugar levels are a bit high, which is why we need to make some adjustments to your diet and insulin regimen. I'm going to provide you with a 2300-calorie meal plan that includes three meals and three snacks per day. The snacks were added last week due to the presence of ketones in your urine. We'll also need to increase your insulin dosage. patient: Okay. I'll follow your instructions. doctor: Good. I'm also going to give you a copy of the Lily Guide for Meal Planning. This will help you make healthy choices and track your carbohydrate intake. patient: Thank you. I appreciate your help. doctor: You're welcome. I'm here to help you have a healthy pregnancy. doctor: I'd like you to work with the following meal plan with a carbohydrate budget representing approximately 45% of the calories from carbohydrates.

For your afternoon snack, you can have one carbohydrate serving. For supper, you can have four carbohydrate servings. And for your bedtime snack, you can have one carbohydrate serving. I'd also like you to include some solid protein with each of your meals as well as with the bedtime snack. You should also try to include three servings of dairy products per day to meet your nutritional needs for calcium during pregnancy. And finally, I recommend including a fruit or a vegetable with most of your meals. patient: That sounds like a lot of food! doctor: It is important to eat enough calories to support your pregnancy, but you also need to be mindful of your carbohydrate intake. That's why it's important to follow the meal plan and to test your blood sugar regularly. patient: I will. doctor: Good. I'm also going to increase your insulin dosage. In the morning, you'll take 24 units of 70/30 insulin, and in the evening, you'll take 16 units. patient: Okay. doctor: I want you to call me if your blood sugar levels are outside of the range of over 90 fasting and over 120 two-hour postprandial. patient: I will. doctor: Good.

My knees aren't hurting me at all anymore, and I haven't needed to take any Bextra. I think the steroid injection that Dr. XYZ gave me really helped. doctor: That's great to hear. Have you been experiencing any shortness of breath, cough, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or constipation? patient: No, I haven't had any of those symptoms. My appetite is good, and I clear my plate at lunch. I haven't had any fevers, chills, or sweats either. friend: Yes, she's been doing very well. She eats excellently at lunchtime, but she continues to lose weight. doctor: I see. When I asked her what she eats for breakfast and supper, she said she doesn't really eat anything. Her only meal that she eats at the nursing home is the noon meal, and I don't think she's eating much the rest of the time. She says she's not hungry except at lunchtime. patient: That's right. I'm just not hungry the rest of the time. doctor: I understand. We did some lab work at your last visit, and your CBC, comprehensive metabolic panel, BUN, creatinine, liver enzymes, and TSH were all normal. Your free albumin was also normal at 23. I know you're on different antidepressants, and that may be causing some difficulties with unintentional weight loss. patient: Yes, I've been taking Aricept 10 mg a day, Prevacid 30 mg a day, Lexapro 10 mg a day, Norvasc 2.5 mg a day, Milk of Magnesia 30 cc daily, and Amanda 10 mg b.i.d. doctor: Okay. I've reviewed your past medical history, and it appears that you have paranoia, which is much improved on your current medications. Your social history is also unchanged. patient: Yes, that's all correct. doctor: Let's take a look at your vitals. Your weight is 123 pounds, which is down 5 pounds from last month and 11 pounds from May 2004. Your blood pressure is 128/62, your pulse is 60, your respirations are 20, and your temperature is 96.8. doctor: Your neck is supple, and your carotids are silent. Your chest is clear to auscultation, and your cardiovascular system is regular rate and rhythm. Your abdomen is soft and nontender, nondistended with positive bowel sounds. No organomegaly or masses are appreciated. Your extremities are free of edema. doctor: Based on your symptoms and examination, I've made the following assessment: 1. Unintentional weight loss. This is likely due to a lack of calorie intake, rather than a medical problem. However, your dementia may make it difficult for you to remember to eat, and your antidepressant medication may also be suppressing your appetite. 2. Depression. You are doing well on your current medications. 3. Paranoia. You are also doing well on your current medications. 4. Dementia. Your dementia is stable. 5. Osteoarthritis of the knees. Your pain is much improved. doctor: Here's my plan: 1. We will continue on your current medications. 2.

But first, let's talk about your Coumadin and the risk of stroke in the setting of atrial fibrillation. patient: Okay. doctor: (Examines the patient's chart) Your vitals are as noted in the chart. You're alert, pleasant, and cooperative. You're not in any apparent distress and you're comfortable in a seated position. I won't be examining you further today. doctor: (Addressing the patient's concerns) For the hematuria, we need to stop the Coumadin so we can evaluate what's going on. It's probably just BPH. We'll also get a repeat UA since you mentioned some dysuria. However, I don't think that would account for the gross hematuria. We'll start you on aspirin 81 mg once a day by mouth. doctor: For the pain, we'll try you on Lortab. You'll get one Lortab 5/500 mg every morning before getting out of bed. You can have a few more throughout the day if you need them. doctor: We'll also see about setting you up with massage therapy and/or physical therapy for your back pain. doctor: And for your sinuses, we'll arrange for you to have saline nasal spray at the bedside for use as needed. patient: Okay, that sounds good. Thank you, Dr. doctor. doctor: You're welcome. If you have any other questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Gross hematuria. Buttock and leg pain.

"doctor: Hello, Ms. Connor. I see you're here for a wound check. How are you doing today? patient: I'm doing well, doctor. My wound has healed nicely, and I'm having good ostomy output. I do have some intermittent pain beneath the upper portion of the incision and in the right lower quadrant below my ostomy. It's not constant, but it can be quite bothersome at times. doctor: I see. And what have you been doing to manage the pain? patient: I've been taking Percocet, which works well. But I ran out, and I've been trying extra strength Tylenol, which sometimes helps. doctor: Okay. Well, I can give you a refill for the Percocet, but I want you to start weaning yourself off of it. I'd like you to try taking ibuprofen or Tylenol first, and only take the Percocet if the pain is severe. patient: Okay, I can do that. doctor: Good. Now, I also want to talk to you about your diet. You mentioned that you've been having some questions about what you can and cannot eat with your ileostomy. patient: Yes, that's right. I'm not sure what foods are safe to eat and which ones to avoid. doctor: Well, there are a few things you should keep in mind. First, you should avoid foods that are high in fiber, such as fruits and vegetables. These foods can cause diarrhea and cramping. You should also avoid foods that are high in fat, such as fried foods and fatty meats. These foods can slow down digestion and cause constipation. patient: I see. So, what can I eat? doctor: There are plenty of foods that you can eat. You can eat bananas, rice, toast, cheese, and peanut butter. These foods are all low in fiber and fat, and they're easy to digest. You can also eat lean meats, fish, and eggs. Just be sure to cook them thoroughly. patient: Okay, that sounds doable. doctor: Good. I'm also going to give you a list of foods to avoid. Please be sure to read it carefully. patient: I will. doctor: Now, I also want to talk to you about the numbness in your right hand and arm. This is likely due to positioning during surgery. It should continue to improve over time. In the meantime, you can do some hand exercises to help speed up the recovery. patient: Okay, I'll do that. doctor: Good. Well, I think that covers everything. I'm happy to see that you're healing well from your surgery. I'll see you back in six months for a routine checkup. patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Follow-up visit for wound check after ostomy surgery.

"doctor: Good morning, Ms. ABC. Thank you for coming in today. I understand you're here for a follow-up regarding your cervical spinal stenosis. patient: Yes, that's right. doctor: Okay. Let's start by talking about your symptoms. You mentioned that you've been having right upper extremity pain, paresthesias, and weakness. Can you tell me a little bit more about that? patient: Sure. The pain is mostly in my right arm and hand. It's a sharp, shooting pain that sometimes radiates down my arm. The paresthesias are like tingling and numbness. And the weakness is mostly in my right hand. I have a hard time opening jars and doors, and I often drop things. doctor: I see. And have you noticed any other symptoms, such as bowel or bladder dysfunction, lower back pain, or lower extremity pain? patient: No, I haven't had any of those symptoms. doctor: Okay. That's good to hear. I'd also like to ask you about your sleep. Have you been having any trouble sleeping? patient: Yes, actually. I've been having some sharp, shooting pain and weakness down my left upper extremity when I'm sleeping. It's really scary. doctor: I understand. That must be very difficult. patient: It is. doctor: Well, I'm glad you came in today so we can talk about this. I've reviewed your medical records, including your cervical spine MRI and radiographs. Based on your history, physical examination, and radiographic findings, it appears that you have C4-5, C5-6 cervical spinal stenosis with associated right greater than left upper extremity radiculopathy. patient: What does that mean? doctor: It means that the spinal canal in your neck is narrowed, which is putting pressure on your spinal cord and nerve roots. This can cause pain, weakness, and paresthesias in your arms and hands. patient: I see. doctor: I've discussed the diagnosis, prognosis, natural history, nonoperative, and operative treatment options with you today. We can continue with nonoperative management, such as physical therapy, or we can add cervical epidural steroid injections. We can also consider surgical intervention. patient: I'm not sure what to do. doctor: I understand. It's a big decision. I want to make sure you have all the information you need to make an informed choice. patient: Okay. doctor: Well, let's talk about the surgical option in more detail. The procedure would involve C4-5, C5-6 anterior cervical decompression and fusion. This would involve removing the bone and tissue that is compressing your spinal cord and nerve roots, and then fusing the vertebrae together to stabilize the spine. patient: What are the risks of surgery? doctor: There are some risks associated with surgery, including bleeding, infection, neurovascular injury, dural tear, singular or multiple muscle weakness, paralysis, hoarseness of voice, difficulty swallowing, pseudoarthrosis, adjacent segment disease, and the risk of this given your relatively young age. patient: That's a lot to consider. doctor: I know it is. But I want you to know that I'm confident that this surgery can help to improve your symptoms. patient: I appreciate that. doctor: You're welcome. I also want to discuss the option of disk arthroplasty. This is a newer procedure that involves replacing the damaged disk with an artificial disk. This can help to preserve motion in the spine. patient: That sounds interesting. doctor: It is. But it's important to note that disk arthroplasty is not always successful. And it's not clear whether it's better than traditional surgery in the long run. patient: I see. doctor: So, ultimately, the decision of whether or not to have surgery is up to you. I'm here to answer any questions you have and to help you make the best decision for your health. patient: Thank you. I appreciate that. doctor: You're welcome. So, what are your thoughts? patient: I think I'd like to proceed with the surgery. doctor: Okay. I'm glad to hear that. We'll schedule your surgery for August 1st. In the meantime, you'll need to complete some preoperative testing. patient: Okay. I'll do that. doctor: Good. I'm confident that this surgery will help you to get back to your old self. patient: Thank you. I hope so too.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Follow-up regarding cervical spinal stenosis.

"doctor: Good morning, Mr. Smith. I understand you've been experiencing a decreased level of consciousness. Can you tell me a little bit about what's been going on? patient: Well, I'm not really sure. I've been feeling really tired and weak for the past day or so. I fell out of my wheelchair the other night and got some cuts on my face. My wife called the ambulance because she found me unresponsive this morning. doctor: I see. Do you remember taking any medication recently? patient: I think I took my Xanax last night, but I'm not sure. My wife said I took a whole milligram instead of the usual 0.125 milligrams. doctor: That could be the cause of your decreased consciousness. Xanax is a sedative, and taking too much of it can lead to drowsiness and confusion. patient: I didn't know that. I've been taking Xanax for years and never had a problem before. doctor: Well, it's important to take your medication exactly as prescribed. Taking too much or too little can be dangerous. patient: I'll be more careful from now on. doctor: That's good to hear.

I've had about 6 bouts of otitis media, and I've been taking antibiotics for them. I also have chronic nasal congestion. doctor: I see. Have you ever had any spontaneous tympanic membrane perforations? patient: No, I haven't. But I have had fevers up to 102 degrees during the acute infections. doctor: Okay. So, we're going to admit you to the hospital today for a myringotomy and tube insertion under general facemask anesthesia. patient: What's that? doctor: It's a surgical procedure where we make a small incision in your eardrum and insert a tiny tube. This will help to drain the fluid from your middle ear and prevent future infections. patient: Okay. doctor: I'm also going to prescribe you some antibiotics to take after the surgery. patient: How long will I have to stay in the hospital? doctor: You'll probably be able to go home the same day. patient: That's a relief. doctor: I know this can be a scary time, but I want to assure you that we're going to take good care of you. patient: Thank you, doctor. doctor: You're welcome.

Your abdomen is soft and nontender, with positive bowel sounds. doctor: Based on my examination and your history, I'm diagnosing you with chronic eustachian tube dysfunction, chronic otitis media with effusion, recurrent acute otitis media, and wax accumulation. patient: What does that mean? doctor: It means that your eustachian tubes, which are the tubes that connect your middle ear to your throat, are not working properly. This is causing fluid to build up in your middle ear, which is leading to infections. The wax accumulation is also contributing to the problem. patient: What can we do about it? doctor: As I mentioned, we're going to do a myringotomy and tube insertion. This will help to drain the fluid from your middle ear and prevent future infections. We're also going to give you antibiotics to treat the current infection. patient: Okay. doctor: I know this is a lot to take in, but I'm here to answer any questions you have. patient: Thank you, doctor.

My blood pressure has been going up lately, and I'm worried about it. doctor: I see. Can you tell me more about what you've been experiencing? patient: Well, I've had high blood pressure for about 15 years now. It's been stable for the past 12-15 years on 10 mg of lisinopril.

on patient and i've been in a lot of pain it started about i would say probably about three days ago doctor okay patient started having pain on my left back doctor okay patient and since then i continued to have pain it is traveling a little lower it's gotten little low but i definitely have not passed it yet and i'm just in so much pain doctor okay so is the pain that you're having is it constant or does it come and go patient it's constant doctor okay patient all the time i ca n't get comfortable doctor alright are you able to urinate patient i am and this morning i actually started seeing some blood doctor okay yeah so and i know you said i see you've had some kidney stones in the past like how many times would you say you've had one of these episodes patient i've had it for probably this might be my third time doctor third time alright patient yeah i have n't had one in a while but yeah this is my third time doctor okay so have you noticed any nausea chills fever patient no fever some chills and i i just in so much pain i i ca n't eat and i do feel a little nauseous doctor okay that sound definitely understandable so you've been in a lot of pain so have you tried to take any medications to alleviate the pain patient yeah i've been taking tylenol i have had to try some ibuprofen i know you said to be careful with my blood pressure but i have been trying to do that because i'm just in so much pain and it's not really working doctor okay and before what would you how long would you say it took you to pass the other stones or how was that that resolved patient yeah usually usually about about three four days to pass it yeah doctor right so this is this is the looks like this is the third day patient yeah doctor so we are getting close there patient okay doctor yeah so hopefully we can pass it but we'll i'll definitely we can take a look at it here in a second so while you are here i also wanted to check up on your your diabetes and and hypertension you have so i'm looking here at my notes and you're on two . five of norvasc for your high blood pressure when you came in today your blood pressure was a was a little bit high and i know that's probably because you are in a bunch of pain so that definitely makes sense but i think last time we talked a little bit about you getting a blood pressure cuff and taking your blood pressures regularly so those readings first off were you able to get the blood pressure cuff patient i was i have n't been great about taking it but i did get the blood pressure cuff doctor so the time that you did take it and i think that's something we got to work on is you've taken them i think at least three times a week i would like you to what have those been running patient like the top numbers they're usually the one thirties sometimes i get i do go into one forties and once it went to like one fifty doctor okay patient and then the bottom number has been between seventy and eighty okay that i mean that's not too bad i think when you were first diagnosed you were up there in the doctor the one eighties which was really high patient right doctor so let me talk a little bit also about you trying to lower your salt intake to like like twenty three hundred milligrams a a day so have you been able to do that patient trying my best but doc i really like my french fries doctor yeah patient like doctor we we all like we all like the french fries you know but you know we we we we also do n't like strokes so we do n't want to have a scope and all the all the french fries so that's something definitely i would like you to work on and do you think you'd be able to to curb that french fry habit or that bad this bad food habits by yourself or do you think you need help patient yeah some help could be helpful okay yeah we can definitely get you connected with someone just to help you with your diet kinda that's the biggest thing for a lot of my patient is trying to control that diet alright doctor so i also want to take a look here at your diabetes and last time you came in your a1c was a little bit higher at seven . three and you're on five hundred of metformin currently so have you been taking your blood sugars before you eat everyday patient i have and those those have been pretty good they are like in the low one hundreds doctor okay that that that's definitely good because when you came in i think we did a glucose test on you couple of months ago and you were around three hundred which is which is pretty up there so i'm glad that you know those levels are down and have you been taking that metformin everyday patient i do doctor okay patient i do take it doctor that that that that's really good alright so let me do a quick physical exam on you just a couple of questions before i take a look at your your abdomen and and your back talked to take a look at that that kidney stones you're having so i just want to make sure are you having any any chest pain patient no chest pain doctor no chest pain are you having any belly pain patient the back pain is starting to kind of go down into my groin but i would n't say any back pain i mean abdominal pain doctor no abdominal pain alright so let me check here i'm gon na listen to your heart real quick and so on your heart exam i do hear a grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur and that we knew about that already so not really worried about that currently listen to your lungs your lungs are clear bilaterally i do n't hear any crackles or wheezes so let me press here on your abdomen does that

is n't any rebound or guarding though and only there is also cva tinnitus on the right on your on your flank as well and so it seems to me you know that you do have that kidney stone looks like you do have some inflammation around your kidney that's what that that's that tenderness around your cva is is telling me so let's go talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you know right now because of your history of of having kidney stones you you do have a kidney stone so what we're gon na do is first off i'm gon na get you some pain medication kinda you're in a ton of pain right now i'm gon na prescribe you some oxycodone five milligrams you can take that every six to eight hours as needed for pain and so hopefully that can help you feeling better and you can continue to take that tylenol for any breakthrough pain that you're having i do wan na make sure that you're pushing fluids right now because we need to try to push that stone out that you're having just kinda clear your kidneys and that that would definitely help i also want to give you a strainer so you can strain your urine to see if you do actually pass that stone and then i'm going to refer you to urology and we're actually i'm gon na have you you even if you pass a stone in the next couple of days i want you to go anyway because it seems like you're having recurrent kidney stones and so hopefully they

"doctor: Hello, patient, thank you for coming in today. I understand you've been experiencing shortness of breath, fatigue, and tiredness. Can you tell me more about that? patient: Yes, doctor.

My activity level has been pretty stable, but I do have a low-grade fever that I've noticed over the past few weeks. doctor: Okay. I'd like to do a few tests to try to figure out what's causing your symptoms. We'll start with a blood test and a chest X-ray. patient: Sure, I'm happy to do that. doctor: (After reviewing the test results) Your blood test shows that you have an elevated white blood cell count, which could be a sign of an infection. Your chest X-ray shows that you have a pericardial effusion, which is a buildup of fluid around your heart. patient: What does that mean? doctor: It means that the sac around your heart is filled with fluid. This can put pressure on your heart and make it difficult to pump blood. In some cases, it can also lead to shortness of breath and chest pain. patient: Is it serious? doctor: It can be, but it depends on the underlying cause. In your case, the effusion appears to be chronic, which means it's been there for a while. We'll need to do some more tests to try to figure out what's causing it. patient: What kind of tests? doctor: We'll start with an echocardiogram, which is an ultrasound of your heart. That will help us get a better look at the effusion and see if it's causing any problems with your heart function. We may also need to do a biopsy of the pericardium, which is the sac around your heart. patient: Okay. I'm a little nervous, but I'll do whatever it takes to get better. doctor: I understand. We'll take good care of you. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe some antibiotics to treat the infection.

Thank you for seeing us. doctor: So, patient had a circumcision a few days ago, and now he's developed some swelling and fever. Can you tell me more about that? patient's mother: Sure. He had a newborn circumcision when he was about a week old, but it didn't go well. He developed a concealed or buried penis, with extra skin and tightness. So, he had a second circumcision with a general anesthetic about 8 or 9 days ago. doctor: I see. And when did the swelling and fever start? patient's mother: It started on Thursday. He had fairly significant swelling in his penis, scrotum, and suprapubic region. He also had a purulent discharge and a fever of 102 to 103 degrees Fahrenheit. doctor: Okay. And when did you bring him to the hospital? patient's mother: We brought him to the hospital on Thursday. He was transferred to Children's Hospital for further care. doctor: I see. And what have the doctors been doing to treat him? patient's mother: They've been giving him clindamycin, and he's now afebrile and showing marked improvement. doctor: That's good to hear. I was requested to consult on his case because of the appearance of his penis. Can I take a look? patient's mother: Sure. doctor: (Examines patient's penis) Okay. I see that he has a buried appearance of the penis after the recent circumcision, with a normal-appearing glans. The tissue itself is quite dull and soft or readily retractable at this time. The scrotum is normal, and there's no erythema or tenderness. Both testes are descended without hydroceles. doctor: I think that the swelling is a mixture of the resolving cellulitis and a suprapubic fat pad. I'm going to recommend that he be treated with Bactrim for a 10-day course at home, bacitracin, or some antibiotics ointment to the penis with each diaper change for the next 2 to 3 weeks, and sitz baths once or twice a day. patient's mother: Okay.
