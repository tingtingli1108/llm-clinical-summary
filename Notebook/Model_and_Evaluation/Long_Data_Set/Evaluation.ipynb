Thank you for coming in today. I understand you've been experiencing some confusion and had a stroke. patient: Yes, that's right. I'm not sure why I'm here, but I had a stroke. doctor: I see. Well, let's start by going over your medical history. You have a history of coronary artery disease and had bypass grafting surgery in the past. Do you remember when and where that was? patient: I'm not sure. I don't remember much about it. doctor: That's okay. We can look that up in your chart. It also says here that you have carotid artery stenosis and had right carotid artery stenting. Again, do you recall when that was? patient: No, I don't remember that either. doctor: No problem. Additionally, you have diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a history of stroke with left-sided hemiplegia. patient: Yes, I remember having a stroke. doctor: I understand. Now, let's talk about your current symptoms. You mentioned confusion. Can you tell me more about that? patient: Well, I've been feeling disoriented and forgetful. I also had trouble speaking and understanding others. doctor: I see. And have you experienced any chest discomfort, shortness of breath, or palpitations? patient: No, I haven't had any of those symptoms. doctor: That's good to hear. I've reviewed your EKG and telemetry results. It shows that you have atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. However, your current telemetry shows normal sinus rhythm. patient: What does that mean? doctor: Atrial fibrillation is a heart rhythm disorder where the upper chambers of your heart (the atria) beat irregularly and rapidly. This can lead to a rapid heart rate and an increased risk of stroke. patient: That sounds serious. doctor: It can be, but we're going to take steps to manage it. I've consulted with cardiology, and we recommend starting you on Coumadin to prevent further strokes. However, given your current neurological status, we need to assess your risk of falling. If the risk is low, we'll proceed with Coumadin. Otherwise, we'll consider aspirin and Plavix. patient: I understand. doctor: Additionally, you have carotid artery stenosis. We'll order a CT angio of the carotid to assess stent patency. However, given your recent stroke, revascularization is not indicated at this time. patient: Okay. doctor: Finally, you have coronary artery disease, but you're clinically stable. We'll monitor that closely. patient: Thank you for explaining everything to me. doctor: You're welcome. We'll continue to monitor your condition and make any necessary adjustments to your treatment plan.\",\n          \"doctor: Hello, patient. I understand you're here today for foot pain? patient: Yes, that's right. I've been having pain in my foot for a while now, and it's been getting worse lately. doctor: Can you tell me more about the pain? Where exactly is it located? patient: It's on the top and lateral aspect of my foot, below my ankle. It's a sharp, stabbing pain that gets worse when I walk or exercise. doctor: Have you seen a doctor about this pain before? patient: Yes, I saw Dr. XYZ last week for back pain, and he prescribed me some pain medication and muscle relaxers. But I've been in here multiple times for different kinds of pain. doctor: I see. And have you had any recent injuries to your foot? patient: No, I haven't injured it recently. It's just been chronically painful. doctor: I understand. Well, let me take a look at your foot. doctor (after examining the patient's foot): Your foot looks okay. There's no redness, swelling, or warmth. The surgical scars are well-healed. There is some mild tenderness around the medial side of your foot, just below the medial malleolus. patient: Yeah, that's where it hurts the most. doctor: I think the pain you're experiencing is likely due to the hardware in your foot. It's possible that the hardware is causing some irritation or inflammation. patient: So, what can I do about it? doctor: Well, we can try some different things to see what helps. I'm going to prescribe you some Lortab 7.5 to help with the pain. I'm also going to refer you to a specialist who can evaluate your foot and determine if the hardware needs to be removed. patient: Okay, thank you. doctor: You're welcome. I hope this helps. patient: Me too. doctor: I also want to talk to you about your primary care physician. You've been seen here multiple times for pain, and it's important to have a regular doctor who can oversee your care. patient: I know, I've been trying to find one. I was supposed to see Dr. XYZ today, but they canceled my appointment because I don't have Project Access insurance yet. doctor: I see. Well, I'm glad to hear that Project Access will be approving your insurance next week. In the meantime, I'm going to keep your chart open so that we can follow up with you and make sure you're getting the care you need. patient: Thank you, I appreciate that. doctor: You're welcome. I'm here to help.\",\n          \"doctor today i'm seeing christina cooper . her date of birth is 07/01/1954 . uh , ms. cooper is a new patient who was referred by diane nelson for a long-standing iron deficiency anemia . doctor hello , how are you ? patient i'm good , thank you . doctor so tell me what brings you in today . patient recently i tried to donate blood , around december i think , and they told me i was anemic , which is something i've been dealing with for a while , so it's not the first time i've been told i'm anemic . doctor or how have you been feeling in general with this ? patient not great . i have been feeling fatigued often during the day , and even feverish with chills at times . when i try to be active i like i ca n't catch my breath and i feel like i'm wheezing . i've had some headaches too , which is not like me . doctor okay . are there any other symptoms ? patient i've been noting some chilling sensations . i also get cold so easily . it's annoying . i feel like i have to really bundle up . i do n't know if this is related but my anxiety and depression feel like it has been getting worse lately . i feel like a mess . doctor sounds like you're not feeling great , obviously . and i'm glad you came to see us . um , we're certainly going to try to figure this out and figure out what's going on , uh , but it sounds like you've been dealing with this anemia for a long time ? patient yeah , i've been anemic since i was 13 years old . doctor right . so why do your doctors think you're anemic ? do you have a history of heavy periods ? patient well i did have heavy periods until i had a hysterectomy in 1996 . but no , they have not told me why they think i'm anemic , which is frustrating honestly . doctor yeah . i can imagine that is . um , let's see if we can help though . since you had your hysterectomy your periods , of course , are no longer the issue . um , when was your last colonoscopy ? patient about five to six years ago . doctor and was it relatively a normal exam ? did you have any polyps ? patient no . they said they'd see me in 10 years . doctor well that's good news . patient yeah , i agree . doctor um , do you have a pacemaker or defibrillator , or have sleep apnea , or use oxygen at night ? patient no . doctor all right . do you ever drink alcohol ? patient yeah , but only once or twice a year . doctor okay . are you taking any supplements such as iron or vitamin b12 ? patient i already started taking my iron pills which i have not taken in about a year . doctor all right . and what are you taking ? patient i'm taking 25 milligram tablets , twice daily . doctor okay , and that's the , the ferrous sulfate ? patient yeah , that's it . i take one in the morning and one in the evening . doctor okay . anything else ?

patient no . doctor okay . you can sit up . so your physical exam is normal without any significant findings . all right ms. cooper , often when we initially see anemia and your host of symptoms , we suspect internal bleeding . patient is that why they want me to have another upper endoscopy ? doctor actually it would be an upper endoscopy and a colonoscopy , but yes , likely that's the reason why . patient lovely . doctor yeah . unfortunately our cameras do not meet all the way in the middle , so if those tests back , come , if those tests come back fine , then we'll have you swallow a pill camera to take pictures as it moves through your , uh , system . patient okay . doctor we may not need to , but it's just the first thing we can do to make sure that you're not losing blood . um , the second thing we can do is have you see a hematologist . they will tell us if you need to give any , to give you any intravenous iron , or maybe something to help your body store the iron better . patient all right . doctor so let's go ahead , get your upper endoscopy and colonoscopy scheduled . patient okay . doctor um , have you ever had any issue with sedation in the past ? patient no , i was just sleepy afterwards . doctor okay . well we will give you a bowel prep to clean out your bowels ahead of time . um , if we do these tests and they are normal , like i said , then we will consider that capsule endoscopy . patient okay . sounds like a plan . doctor all right . so after that you'll be all done and we will send you to the hematologist . additionally , i'm going to need you to start taking your iron pills with orange juice . uh , the vitamin c will help you absorb the iron better . do this for about 8-12 weeks , uh , and then we can reassess your blood work . patient okay , that sounds great . doctor all right . well i think we have our plan . on your way out , stop by and schedule your upper endoscopy and c- colonoscopy . uh , we will send a referral to dr. flores who is is the hematologist , so schedule that appointment . um , here are your instructions for the pre- uh , the bowel prep . uh , call us if you have any questions or worsening symptoms . we'll be happy to help you . patient thank you . doctor you're welcome . have a great day , have a great day ms. cooper . patient you too . doctor all right . this is christina cooper , pleasant 65 year old female who was diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia in 12-2019 , and w- and was unable to donate blood . um , her followup blood work on 01/20/20 was revealed a low hemoglobin , stable hematocrit and normal iron labs , although ferritin was low . um , she was taking ferrous sulfate , three hundred , twenty phil- 25 milligrams by mouth . i've asked her to continue each dose with vitamin c found in orange juice , for the next 12 weeks , then recheck to the cbc , iron , ferritin , b12 , and folate . um , a referral was sent to her hematologist . we will plan for an egd and a colonoscopy to assess for potential sources of anemia or gi bleed . if this is inconclusive , capsule endoscopy will be considered . thanks .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Reference\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 180,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Confusion and history of stroke. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a pleasant age-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of confusion and history of stroke. The patient reports feeling disoriented and forgetful. She also had trouble speaking and understanding others. She denies chest discomfort, shortness of breath, or palpitations. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and had bypass grafting surgery in the past. She also has carotid artery stenosis and had right carotid artery stenting. Additionally, she has diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a history of stroke with left-sided hemiplegia. The patient's EKG and telemetry results show atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. However, her current telemetry shows normal sinus rhythm. The patient has carotid artery stenosis. A CT angio of the carotid will be ordered to assess stent patency. The patient will be started on Coumadin to prevent further strokes. However, given her current neurological status, the risk of falling will be assessed. If the risk is low, Coumadin will be initiated. Otherwise, aspirin and Plavix will be considered. The patient will be monitored closely for her coronary artery disease. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response Assessment: Atrial fibrillation is a heart rhythm disorder where the upper chambers of the patient's heart (the atria) beat irregularly and rapidly. This can lead to a rapid heart rate and an increased risk of stroke. The patient has a history of stroke, which is a risk factor for developing atrial fibrillation. Plan: - Will consult cardiology. - Will assess patient's risk of falling. - If risk is low, will start Coumadin. If risk is high, will consider aspirin and Plavix. 2. Carotid artery stenosis Assessment: Carotid artery stenosis is a narrowing of the carotid arteries, which are the main arteries that supply blood to the brain. This can increase the risk of stroke. The patient had right carotid artery stenting in the past, but the patency of the stent is unknown. Plan: - Will order CT angio of the carotid to assess stent patency. 3. Coronary artery disease Assessment: Coronary artery disease is a narrowing of the arteries that supply blood to the heart. This can lead to chest pain, shortness of breath, and heart attacks. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and had bypass grafting surgery in the past. He is currently clinically stable. Plan: - Will monitor the patient's condition closely. 4. Left-sided hemiplegia Assessment: Left-sided hemiplegia is a weakness or paralysis of the left side of the body. This is a result of the patient's previous stroke. Plan: - Will continue to monitor the patient's neurological status. - Will provide rehabilitation as needed. Follow-up instructions: - The patient will follow up with cardiology in 1 week.\",\n          \"SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Foot pain.

Thank you for coming in today. I understand you've been experiencing some confusion and had a stroke. patient: Yes, that's right. I'm not sure why I'm here, but I had a stroke. doctor: I see. Well, let's start by going over your medical history. You have a history of coronary artery disease and had bypass grafting surgery in the past. Do you remember when and where that was? patient: I'm not sure. I don't remember much about it. doctor: That's okay. We can look that up in your chart. It also says here that you have carotid artery stenosis and had right carotid artery stenting. Again, do you recall when that was? patient: No, I don't remember that either. doctor: No problem. Additionally, you have diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a history of stroke with left-sided hemiplegia. patient: Yes, I remember having a stroke. doctor: I understand. Now, let's talk about your current symptoms. You mentioned confusion. Can you tell me more about that? patient: Well, I've been feeling disoriented and forgetful. I also had trouble speaking and understanding others. doctor: I see. And have you experienced any chest discomfort, shortness of breath, or palpitations? patient: No, I haven't had any of those symptoms. doctor: That's good to hear. I've reviewed your EKG and telemetry results. It shows that you have atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. However, your current telemetry shows normal sinus rhythm. patient: What does that mean? doctor: Atrial fibrillation is a heart rhythm disorder where the upper chambers of your heart (the atria) beat irregularly and rapidly. This can lead to a rapid heart rate and an increased risk of stroke. patient: That sounds serious. doctor: It can be, but we're going to take steps to manage it. I've consulted with cardiology, and we recommend starting you on Coumadin to prevent further strokes. However, given your current neurological status, we need to assess your risk of falling. If the risk is low, we'll proceed with Coumadin. Otherwise, we'll consider aspirin and Plavix. patient: I understand. doctor: Additionally, you have carotid artery stenosis. We'll order a CT angio of the carotid to assess stent patency. However, given your recent stroke, revascularization is not indicated at this time. patient: Okay. doctor: Finally, you have coronary artery disease, but you're clinically stable. We'll monitor that closely. patient: Thank you for explaining everything to me. doctor: You're welcome. We'll continue to monitor your condition and make any necessary adjustments to your treatment plan.\",\n          \"doctor: Hello, patient. I understand you're here today for foot pain? patient: Yes, that's right. I've been having pain in my foot for a while now, and it's been getting worse lately. doctor: Can you tell me more about the pain? Where exactly is it located? patient: It's on the top and lateral aspect of my foot, below my ankle. It's a sharp, stabbing pain that gets worse when I walk or exercise. doctor: Have you seen a doctor about this pain before? patient: Yes, I saw Dr. XYZ last week for back pain, and he prescribed me some pain medication and muscle relaxers. But I've been in here multiple times for different kinds of pain. doctor: I see. And have you had any recent injuries to your foot? patient: No, I haven't injured it recently. It's just been chronically painful. doctor: I understand. Well, let me take a look at your foot. doctor (after examining the patient's foot): Your foot looks okay. There's no redness, swelling, or warmth. The surgical scars are well-healed. There is some mild tenderness around the medial side of your foot, just below the medial malleolus. patient: Yeah, that's where it hurts the most. doctor: I think the pain you're experiencing is likely due to the hardware in your foot. It's possible that the hardware is causing some irritation or inflammation. patient: So, what can I do about it? doctor: Well, we can try some different things to see what helps. I'm going to prescribe you some Lortab 7.5 to help with the pain. I'm also going to refer you to a specialist who can evaluate your foot and determine if the hardware needs to be removed. patient: Okay, thank you. doctor: You're welcome. I hope this helps. patient: Me too. doctor: I also want to talk to you about your primary care physician. You've been seen here multiple times for pain, and it's important to have a regular doctor who can oversee your care. patient: I know, I've been trying to find one. I was supposed to see Dr. XYZ today, but they canceled my appointment because I don't have Project Access insurance yet. doctor: I see. Well, I'm glad to hear that Project Access will be approving your insurance next week. In the meantime, I'm going to keep your chart open so that we can follow up with you and make sure you're getting the care you need. patient: Thank you, I appreciate that. doctor: You're welcome.

patient about five to six years ago . doctor and was it relatively a normal exam ? did you have any polyps ? patient no . they said they'd see me in 10 years . doctor well that's good news . patient yeah , i agree . doctor um , do you have a pacemaker or defibrillator , or have sleep apnea , or use oxygen at night ? patient no . doctor all right . do you ever drink alcohol ? patient yeah , but only once or twice a year . doctor okay . are you taking any supplements such as iron or vitamin b12 ? patient i already started taking my iron pills which i have not taken in about a year . doctor all right . and what are you taking ? patient i'm taking 25 milligram tablets , twice daily . doctor okay , and that's the , the ferrous sulfate ? patient yeah , that's it . i take one in the morning and one in the evening . doctor okay . anything else ? patient yeah , i take vitamin b12 , just the over the counter stuff . doctor okay , very good . all right , well let's go ahead and take a look and see what's going on . patient sounds good . thank you . doctor of course . you'll hear me , uh , talk through your exam so that i get all the information documented . patient okay . doctor all right . so use my general physical exam template . i will start by listening to your heart and lungs . patient okay . doctor all right . next , i'd like you to lay back so i can examine your abdomen . patient okay . doctor is there any tenderness where i'm pressing ? patient no . doctor okay . you can sit up . so your physical exam is normal without any significant findings . all right ms. cooper , often when we initially see anemia and your host of symptoms , we suspect internal bleeding . patient is that why they want me to have another upper endoscopy ? doctor actually it would be an upper endoscopy and a colonoscopy , but yes , likely that's the reason why . patient lovely . doctor yeah . unfortunately our cameras do not meet all the way in the middle , so if those tests back , come , if those tests come back fine , then we'll have you swallow a pill camera to take pictures as it moves through your , uh , system . patient okay . doctor we may not need to , but it's just the first thing we can do to make sure that you're not losing blood . um , the second thing we can do is have you see a hematologist . they will tell us if you need to give any , to give you any intravenous iron , or maybe something to help your body store the iron better . patient all right . doctor so let's go ahead , get your upper endoscopy and colonoscopy scheduled . patient okay . doctor um , have you ever had any issue with sedation in the past ? patient no , i was just sleepy afterwards . doctor okay . well we will give you a bowel prep to clean out your bowels ahead of time . um , if we do these tests and they are normal , like i said , then we will consider that capsule endoscopy . patient okay . sounds like a plan . doctor all right . so after that you'll be all done and we will send you to the hematologist . additionally , i'm going to need you to start taking your iron pills with orange juice . uh , the vitamin c will help you absorb the iron better . do this for about 8-12 weeks , uh , and then we can reassess your blood work . patient okay , that sounds great . doctor all right . well i think we have our plan . on your way out , stop by and schedule your upper endoscopy and c- colonoscopy . uh , we will send a referral to dr. flores who is is the hematologist , so schedule that appointment . um , here are your instructions for the pre- uh , the bowel prep . uh , call us if you have any questions or worsening symptoms . we'll be happy to help you . patient thank you . doctor you're welcome . have a great day , have a great day ms. cooper . patient you too . doctor all right . this is christina cooper , pleasant 65 year old female who was diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia in 12-2019 , and w- and was unable to donate blood . um , her followup blood work on 01/20/20 was revealed a low hemoglobin , stable hematocrit and normal iron labs , although ferritin was low . um , she was taking ferrous sulfate , three hundred , twenty phil- 25 milligrams by mouth . i've asked her to continue each dose with vitamin c found in orange juice , for the next 12 weeks , then recheck to the cbc , iron , ferritin , b12 , and folate . um , a referral was sent to her hematologist . we will plan for an egd and a colonoscopy to assess for potential sources of anemia or gi bleed . if this is inconclusive , capsule endoscopy will be considered . thanks .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Reference\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 180,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Confusion and history of stroke. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a pleasant age-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of confusion and history of stroke. The patient reports feeling disoriented and forgetful. She also had trouble speaking and understanding others. She denies chest discomfort, shortness of breath, or palpitations. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and had bypass grafting surgery in the past. She also has carotid artery stenosis and had right carotid artery stenting. Additionally, she has diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a history of stroke with left-sided hemiplegia. The patient's EKG and telemetry results show atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. However, her current telemetry shows normal sinus rhythm. The patient has carotid artery stenosis. A CT angio of the carotid will be ordered to assess stent patency. The patient will be started on Coumadin to prevent further strokes. However, given her current neurological status, the risk of falling will be assessed. If the risk is low, Coumadin will be initiated. Otherwise, aspirin and Plavix will be considered. The patient will be monitored closely for her coronary artery disease. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response Assessment: Atrial fibrillation is a heart rhythm disorder where the upper chambers of the patient's heart (the atria) beat irregularly and rapidly. This can lead to a rapid heart rate and an increased risk of stroke. The patient has a history of stroke, which is a risk factor for developing atrial fibrillation. Plan: - Will consult cardiology. - Will assess patient's risk of falling. - If risk is low, will start Coumadin. If risk is high, will consider aspirin and Plavix. 2. Carotid artery stenosis Assessment: Carotid artery stenosis is a narrowing of the carotid arteries, which are the main arteries that supply blood to the brain. This can increase the risk of stroke. The patient had right carotid artery stenting in the past, but the patency of the stent is unknown. Plan: - Will order CT angio of the carotid to assess stent patency. 3. Coronary artery disease Assessment: Coronary artery disease is a narrowing of the arteries that supply blood to the heart. This can lead to chest pain, shortness of breath, and heart attacks. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and had bypass grafting surgery in the past. He is currently clinically stable. Plan: - Will monitor the patient's condition closely. 4. Left-sided hemiplegia Assessment: Left-sided hemiplegia is a weakness or paralysis of the left side of the body. This is a result of the patient's previous stroke. Plan: - Will continue to monitor the patient's neurological status. - Will provide rehabilitation as needed. Follow-up instructions: - The patient will follow up with cardiology in 1 week.\",\n          \"SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Foot pain.

Thank you for coming in today. I understand you've been experiencing some confusion and had a stroke. patient: Yes, that's right. I'm not sure why I'm here, but I had a stroke. doctor: I see. Well, let's start by going over your medical history. You have a history of coronary artery disease and had bypass grafting surgery in the past. Do you remember when and where that was? patient: I'm not sure. I don't remember much about it. doctor: That's okay. We can look that up in your chart. It also says here that you have carotid artery stenosis and had right carotid artery stenting. Again, do you recall when that was? patient: No, I don't remember that either. doctor: No problem. Additionally, you have diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a history of stroke with left-sided hemiplegia. patient: Yes, I remember having a stroke. doctor: I understand. Now, let's talk about your current symptoms. You mentioned confusion. Can you tell me more about that? patient: Well, I've been feeling disoriented and forgetful. I also had trouble speaking and understanding others. doctor: I see. And have you experienced any chest discomfort, shortness of breath, or palpitations? patient: No, I haven't had any of those symptoms. doctor: That's good to hear. I've reviewed your EKG and telemetry results. It shows that you have atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. However, your current telemetry shows normal sinus rhythm. patient: What does that mean? doctor: Atrial fibrillation is a heart rhythm disorder where the upper chambers of your heart (the atria) beat irregularly and rapidly. This can lead to a rapid heart rate and an increased risk of stroke. patient: That sounds serious. doctor: It can be, but we're going to take steps to manage it. I've consulted with cardiology, and we recommend starting you on Coumadin to prevent further strokes. However, given your current neurological status, we need to assess your risk of falling. If the risk is low, we'll proceed with Coumadin. Otherwise, we'll consider aspirin and Plavix. patient: I understand. doctor: Additionally, you have carotid artery stenosis. We'll order a CT angio of the carotid to assess stent patency. However, given your recent stroke, revascularization is not indicated at this time. patient: Okay. doctor: Finally, you have coronary artery disease, but you're clinically stable. We'll monitor that closely. patient: Thank you for explaining everything to me. doctor: You're welcome. We'll continue to monitor your condition and make any necessary adjustments to your treatment plan.\",\n          \"doctor: Hello, patient. I understand you're here today for foot pain? patient: Yes, that's right. I've been having pain in my foot for a while now, and it's been getting worse lately. doctor: Can you tell me more about the pain? Where exactly is it located? patient: It's on the top and lateral aspect of my foot, below my ankle. It's a sharp, stabbing pain that gets worse when I walk or exercise. doctor: Have you seen a doctor about this pain before? patient: Yes, I saw Dr. XYZ last week for back pain, and he prescribed me some pain medication and muscle relaxers. But I've been in here multiple times for different kinds of pain. doctor: I see. And have you had any recent injuries to your foot? patient: No, I haven't injured it recently. It's just been chronically painful. doctor: I understand. Well, let me take a look at your foot. doctor (after examining the patient's foot): Your foot looks okay. There's no redness, swelling, or warmth. The surgical scars are well-healed. There is some mild tenderness around the medial side of your foot, just below the medial malleolus. patient: Yeah, that's where it hurts the most. doctor: I think the pain you're experiencing is likely due to the hardware in your foot. It's possible that the hardware is causing some irritation or inflammation. patient: So, what can I do about it? doctor: Well, we can try some different things to see what helps. I'm going to prescribe you some Lortab 7.5 to help with the pain. I'm also going to refer you to a specialist who can evaluate your foot and determine if the hardware needs to be removed. patient: Okay, thank you. doctor: You're welcome. I hope this helps. patient: Me too. doctor: I also want to talk to you about your primary care physician. You've been seen here multiple times for pain, and it's important to have a regular doctor who can oversee your care. patient: I know, I've been trying to find one. I was supposed to see Dr. XYZ today, but they canceled my appointment because I don't have Project Access insurance yet. doctor: I see. Well, I'm glad to hear that Project Access will be approving your insurance next week. In the meantime, I'm going to keep your chart open so that we can follow up with you and make sure you're getting the care you need. patient: Thank you, I appreciate that. doctor: You're welcome. I'm here to help.\",\n          \"doctor today i'm seeing christina cooper . her date of birth is 07/01/1954 . uh , ms. cooper is a new patient who was referred by diane nelson for a long-standing iron deficiency anemia . doctor hello , how are you ? patient i'm good , thank you . doctor so tell me what brings you in today . patient recently i tried to donate blood , around december i think , and they told me i was anemic , which is something i've been dealing with for a while , so it's not the first time i've been told i'm anemic . doctor or how have you been feeling in general with this ? patient not great . i have been feeling fatigued often during the day , and even feverish with chills at times . when i try to be active i like i ca n't catch my breath and i feel like i'm wheezing . i've had some headaches too , which is not like me . doctor okay . are there any other symptoms ? patient i've been noting some chilling sensations . i also get cold so easily . it's annoying . i feel like i have to really bundle up . i do n't know if this is related but my anxiety and depression feel like it has been getting worse lately . i feel like a mess . doctor sounds like you're not feeling great , obviously . and i'm glad you came to see us . um , we're certainly going to try to figure this out and figure out what's going on , uh , but it sounds like you've been dealing with this anemia for a long time ? patient yeah , i've been anemic since i was 13 years old . doctor right . so why do your doctors think you're anemic ? do you have a history of heavy periods ? patient well i did have heavy periods until i had a hysterectomy in 1996 . but no , they have not told me why they think i'm anemic , which is frustrating honestly . doctor yeah . i can imagine that is . um , let's see if we can help though . since you had your hysterectomy your periods , of course , are no longer the issue . um , when was your last colonoscopy ? patient about five to six years ago . doctor and was it relatively a normal exam ? did you have any polyps ? patient no . they said they'd see me in 10 years . doctor well that's good news . patient yeah , i agree . doctor um , do you have a pacemaker or defibrillator , or have sleep apnea , or use oxygen at night ? patient no . doctor all right . do you ever drink alcohol ? patient yeah , but only once or twice a year . doctor okay . are you taking any supplements such as iron or vitamin b12 ? patient i already started taking my iron pills which i have not taken in about a year . doctor all right . and what are you taking ? patient i'm taking 25 milligram tablets , twice daily . doctor okay , and that's the , the ferrous sulfate ? patient yeah , that's it . i take one in the morning and one in the evening . doctor okay . anything else ? patient yeah , i take vitamin b12 , just the over the counter stuff . doctor okay , very good . all right , well let's go ahead and take a look and see what's going on . patient sounds good . thank you . doctor of course . you'll hear me , uh , talk through your exam so that i get all the information documented . patient okay . doctor all right . so use my general physical exam template . i will start by listening to your heart and lungs . patient okay . doctor all right . next , i'd like you to lay back so i can examine your abdomen . patient okay . doctor is there any tenderness where i'm pressing ? patient no . doctor okay . you can sit up . so your physical exam is normal without any significant findings . all right ms. cooper , often when we initially see anemia and your host of symptoms , we suspect internal bleeding . patient is that why they want me to have another upper endoscopy ? doctor actually it would be an upper endoscopy and a colonoscopy , but yes , likely that's the reason why . patient lovely . doctor yeah . unfortunately our cameras do not meet all the way in the middle , so if those tests back , come , if those tests come back fine , then we'll have you swallow a pill camera to take pictures as it moves through your , uh , system . patient okay . doctor we may not need to , but it's just the first thing we can do to make sure that you're not losing blood . um , the second thing we can do is have you see a hematologist . they will tell us if you need to give any , to give you any intravenous iron , or maybe something to help your body store the iron better . patient all right . doctor so let's go ahead , get your upper endoscopy and colonoscopy scheduled . patient okay . doctor um , have you ever had any issue with sedation in the past ? patient no , i was just sleepy afterwards . doctor okay . well we will give you a bowel prep to clean out your bowels ahead of time . um , if we do these tests and they are normal , like i said , then we will consider that capsule endoscopy . patient okay . sounds like a plan . doctor all right . so after that you'll be all done and we will send you to the hematologist . additionally , i'm going to need you to start taking your iron pills with orange juice . uh , the vitamin c will help you absorb the iron better . do this for about 8-12 weeks , uh , and then we can reassess your blood work . patient okay , that sounds great . doctor all right . well i think we have our plan . on your way out , stop by and schedule your upper endoscopy and c- colonoscopy . uh , we will send a referral to dr. flores who is is the hematologist , so schedule that appointment . um , here are your instructions for the pre- uh , the bowel prep . uh , call us if you have any questions or worsening symptoms . we'll be happy to help you . patient thank you . doctor you're welcome . have a great day , have a great day ms. cooper . patient you too . doctor all right . this is christina cooper , pleasant 65 year old female who was diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia in 12-2019 , and w- and was unable to donate blood . um , her followup blood work on 01/20/20 was revealed a low hemoglobin , stable hematocrit and normal iron labs , although ferritin was low . um , she was taking ferrous sulfate , three hundred , twenty phil- 25 milligrams by mouth . i've asked her to continue each dose with vitamin c found in orange juice , for the next 12 weeks , then recheck to the cbc , iron , ferritin , b12 , and folate . um , a referral was sent to her hematologist . we will plan for an egd and a colonoscopy to assess for potential sources of anemia or gi bleed . if this is inconclusive , capsule endoscopy will be considered . thanks .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Reference\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 180,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Confusion and history of stroke. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a pleasant age-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of confusion and history of stroke. The patient reports feeling disoriented and forgetful. She also had trouble speaking and understanding others. She denies chest discomfort, shortness of breath, or palpitations. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and had bypass grafting surgery in the past. She also has carotid artery stenosis and had right carotid artery stenting. Additionally, she has diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a history of stroke with left-sided hemiplegia. The patient's EKG and telemetry results show atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. However, her current telemetry shows normal sinus rhythm. The patient has carotid artery stenosis. A CT angio of the carotid will be ordered to assess stent patency. The patient will be started on Coumadin to prevent further strokes. However, given her current neurological status, the risk of falling will be assessed. If the risk is low, Coumadin will be initiated. Otherwise, aspirin and Plavix will be considered. The patient will be monitored closely for her coronary artery disease. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response Assessment: Atrial fibrillation is a heart rhythm disorder where the upper chambers of the patient's heart (the atria) beat irregularly and rapidly. This can lead to a rapid heart rate and an increased risk of stroke. The patient has a history of stroke, which is a risk factor for developing atrial fibrillation. Plan: - Will consult cardiology. - Will assess patient's risk of falling. - If risk is low, will start Coumadin. If risk is high, will consider aspirin and Plavix. 2. Carotid artery stenosis Assessment: Carotid artery stenosis is a narrowing of the carotid arteries, which are the main arteries that supply blood to the brain. This can increase the risk of stroke. The patient had right carotid artery stenting in the past, but the patency of the stent is unknown. Plan: - Will order CT angio of the carotid to assess stent patency. 3. Coronary artery disease Assessment: Coronary artery disease is a narrowing of the arteries that supply blood to the heart. This can lead to chest pain, shortness of breath, and heart attacks. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and had bypass grafting surgery in the past. He is currently clinically stable. Plan: - Will monitor the patient's condition closely. 4. Left-sided hemiplegia Assessment: Left-sided hemiplegia is a weakness or paralysis of the left side of the body. This is a result of the patient's previous stroke. Plan: - Will continue to monitor the patient's neurological status. - Will provide rehabilitation as needed. Follow-up instructions: - The patient will follow up with cardiology in 1 week.\",\n          \"SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Foot pain.

Thank you for coming in today. I understand you've been experiencing some confusion and had a stroke. patient: Yes, that's right. I'm not sure why I'm here, but I had a stroke. doctor: I see. Well, let's start by going over your medical history. You have a history of coronary artery disease and had bypass grafting surgery in the past. Do you remember when and where that was? patient: I'm not sure. I don't remember much about it. doctor: That's okay. We can look that up in your chart. It also says here that you have carotid artery stenosis and had right carotid artery stenting. Again, do you recall when that was? patient: No, I don't remember that either. doctor: No problem. Additionally, you have diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a history of stroke with left-sided hemiplegia. patient: Yes, I remember having a stroke. doctor: I understand. Now, let's talk about your current symptoms. You mentioned confusion. Can you tell me more about that? patient: Well, I've been feeling disoriented and forgetful. I also had trouble speaking and understanding others. doctor: I see. And have you experienced any chest discomfort, shortness of breath, or palpitations? patient: No, I haven't had any of those symptoms. doctor: That's good to hear. I've reviewed your EKG and telemetry results. It shows that you have atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. However, your current telemetry shows normal sinus rhythm. patient: What does that mean? doctor: Atrial fibrillation is a heart rhythm disorder where the upper chambers of your heart (the atria) beat irregularly and rapidly. This can lead to a rapid heart rate and an increased risk of stroke. patient: That sounds serious. doctor: It can be, but we're going to take steps to manage it. I've consulted with cardiology, and we recommend starting you on Coumadin to prevent further strokes. However, given your current neurological status, we need to assess your risk of falling. If the risk is low, we'll proceed with Coumadin. Otherwise, we'll consider aspirin and Plavix. patient: I understand. doctor: Additionally, you have carotid artery stenosis. We'll order a CT angio of the carotid to assess stent patency. However, given your recent stroke, revascularization is not indicated at this time. patient: Okay. doctor: Finally, you have coronary artery disease, but you're clinically stable. We'll monitor that closely. patient: Thank you for explaining everything to me. doctor: You're welcome. We'll continue to monitor your condition and make any necessary adjustments to your treatment plan.\",\n          \"doctor: Hello, patient. I understand you're here today for foot pain? patient: Yes, that's right. I've been having pain in my foot for a while now, and it's been getting worse lately. doctor: Can you tell me more about the pain? Where exactly is it located? patient: It's on the top and lateral aspect of my foot, below my ankle. It's a sharp, stabbing pain that gets worse when I walk or exercise. doctor: Have you seen a doctor about this pain before? patient: Yes, I saw Dr. XYZ last week for back pain, and he prescribed me some pain medication and muscle relaxers. But I've been in here multiple times for different kinds of pain. doctor: I see. And have you had any recent injuries to your foot? patient: No, I haven't injured it recently. It's just been chronically painful. doctor: I understand. Well, let me take a look at your foot. doctor (after examining the patient's foot): Your foot looks okay. There's no redness, swelling, or warmth. The surgical scars are well-healed. There is some mild tenderness around the medial side of your foot, just below the medial malleolus. patient: Yeah, that's where it hurts the most. doctor: I think the pain you're experiencing is likely due to the hardware in your foot. It's possible that the hardware is causing some irritation or inflammation. patient: So, what can I do about it? doctor: Well, we can try some different things to see what helps. I'm going to prescribe you some Lortab 7.5 to help with the pain. I'm also going to refer you to a specialist who can evaluate your foot and determine if the hardware needs to be removed. patient: Okay, thank you. doctor: You're welcome. I hope this helps. patient: Me too. doctor: I also want to talk to you about your primary care physician. You've been seen here multiple times for pain, and it's important to have a regular doctor who can oversee your care. patient: I know, I've been trying to find one. I was supposed to see Dr. XYZ today, but they canceled my appointment because I don't have Project Access insurance yet. doctor: I see. Well, I'm glad to hear that Project Access will be approving your insurance next week. In the meantime, I'm going to keep your chart open so that we can follow up with you and make sure you're getting the care you need. patient: Thank you, I appreciate that. doctor: You're welcome.

patient about five to six years ago . doctor and was it relatively a normal exam ? did you have any polyps ? patient no . they said they'd see me in 10 years . doctor well that's good news . patient yeah , i agree . doctor um , do you have a pacemaker or defibrillator , or have sleep apnea , or use oxygen at night ? patient no . doctor all right . do you ever drink alcohol ? patient yeah , but only once or twice a year . doctor okay . are you taking any supplements such as iron or vitamin b12 ? patient i already started taking my iron pills which i have not taken in about a year . doctor all right . and what are you taking ? patient i'm taking 25 milligram tablets , twice daily . doctor okay , and that's the , the ferrous sulfate ? patient yeah , that's it . i take one in the morning and one in the evening . doctor okay . anything else ?

patient no . doctor okay . you can sit up . so your physical exam is normal without any significant findings . all right ms. cooper , often when we initially see anemia and your host of symptoms , we suspect internal bleeding . patient is that why they want me to have another upper endoscopy ? doctor actually it would be an upper endoscopy and a colonoscopy , but yes , likely that's the reason why . patient lovely . doctor yeah . unfortunately our cameras do not meet all the way in the middle , so if those tests back , come , if those tests come back fine , then we'll have you swallow a pill camera to take pictures as it moves through your , uh , system . patient okay . doctor we may not need to , but it's just the first thing we can do to make sure that you're not losing blood . um , the second thing we can do is have you see a hematologist . they will tell us if you need to give any , to give you any intravenous iron , or maybe something to help your body store the iron better . patient all right . doctor so let's go ahead , get your upper endoscopy and colonoscopy scheduled . patient okay . doctor um , have you ever had any issue with sedation in the past ? patient no , i was just sleepy afterwards . doctor okay . well we will give you a bowel prep to clean out your bowels ahead of time . um , if we do these tests and they are normal , like i said , then we will consider that capsule endoscopy . patient okay . sounds like a plan . doctor all right . so after that you'll be all done and we will send you to the hematologist . additionally , i'm going to need you to start taking your iron pills with orange juice . uh , the vitamin c will help you absorb the iron better . do this for about 8-12 weeks , uh , and then we can reassess your blood work . patient okay , that sounds great . doctor all right . well i think we have our plan . on your way out , stop by and schedule your upper endoscopy and c- colonoscopy . uh , we will send a referral to dr. flores who is is the hematologist , so schedule that appointment . um , here are your instructions for the pre- uh , the bowel prep . uh , call us if you have any questions or worsening symptoms . we'll be happy to help you . patient thank you . doctor you're welcome . have a great day , have a great day ms. cooper . patient you too . doctor all right . this is christina cooper , pleasant 65 year old female who was diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia in 12-2019 , and w- and was unable to donate blood . um , her followup blood work on 01/20/20 was revealed a low hemoglobin , stable hematocrit and normal iron labs , although ferritin was low . um , she was taking ferrous sulfate , three hundred , twenty phil- 25 milligrams by mouth . i've asked her to continue each dose with vitamin c found in orange juice , for the next 12 weeks , then recheck to the cbc , iron , ferritin , b12 , and folate . um , a referral was sent to her hematologist . we will plan for an egd and a colonoscopy to assess for potential sources of anemia or gi bleed . if this is inconclusive , capsule endoscopy will be considered . thanks .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Reference\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 180,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Confusion and history of stroke. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a pleasant age-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of confusion and history of stroke. The patient reports feeling disoriented and forgetful. She also had trouble speaking and understanding others. She denies chest discomfort, shortness of breath, or palpitations. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and had bypass grafting surgery in the past. She also has carotid artery stenosis and had right carotid artery stenting. Additionally, she has diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a history of stroke with left-sided hemiplegia. The patient's EKG and telemetry results show atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. However, her current telemetry shows normal sinus rhythm. The patient has carotid artery stenosis. A CT angio of the carotid will be ordered to assess stent patency. The patient will be started on Coumadin to prevent further strokes. However, given her current neurological status, the risk of falling will be assessed. If the risk is low, Coumadin will be initiated. Otherwise, aspirin and Plavix will be considered. The patient will be monitored closely for her coronary artery disease. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response Assessment: Atrial fibrillation is a heart rhythm disorder where the upper chambers of the patient's heart (the atria) beat irregularly and rapidly. This can lead to a rapid heart rate and an increased risk of stroke. The patient has a history of stroke, which is a risk factor for developing atrial fibrillation. Plan: - Will consult cardiology. - Will assess patient's risk of falling. - If risk is low, will start Coumadin. If risk is high, will consider aspirin and Plavix. 2. Carotid artery stenosis Assessment: Carotid artery stenosis is a narrowing of the carotid arteries, which are the main arteries that supply blood to the brain. This can increase the risk of stroke. The patient had right carotid artery stenting in the past, but the patency of the stent is unknown. Plan: - Will order CT angio of the carotid to assess stent patency. 3. Coronary artery disease Assessment: Coronary artery disease is a narrowing of the arteries that supply blood to the heart. This can lead to chest pain, shortness of breath, and heart attacks. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and had bypass grafting surgery in the past. He is currently clinically stable. Plan: - Will monitor the patient's condition closely. 4. Left-sided hemiplegia Assessment: Left-sided hemiplegia is a weakness or paralysis of the left side of the body. This is a result of the patient's previous stroke. Plan: - Will continue to monitor the patient's neurological status. - Will provide rehabilitation as needed. Follow-up instructions: - The patient will follow up with cardiology in 1 week.\",\n          \"SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Foot pain.
