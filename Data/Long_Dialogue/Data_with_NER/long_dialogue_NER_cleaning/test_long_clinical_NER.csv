"doctor: Good morning, Mr. A. Thank you for coming in today. I understand you're here for a new patient evaluation. patient: That's right. doctor: Can you tell me a little bit about your medical history? patient: Well, I've had two surgeries in the past. The first was in July of 2006, and the second was in August of 2007. After that, I started having seizures and hemiparesis. I've been in and out of the hospital, and I developed C. diff. I'm currently in a nursing home because I'm unable to care for myself. doctor: I see. I've reviewed your medical records, including the information from the nursing home. It looks like you're taking Keppra, Decadron, oxycodone, aspirin, Prilosec, Dilantin, and Flagyl. Is that correct? patient: Yes, that's right. doctor: Okay. I've also reviewed your imaging studies. It shows that you have a malignant meningioma with progression of disease and significant brain edema. patient: What does that mean? doctor: It means that the tumor has grown and is causing swelling in your brain. This is causing your symptoms, such as the seizures, hemiparesis, and confusion. patient: So what can be done about it? doctor: Unfortunately, there are no good treatment options for malignant meningioma. Chemotherapy is an option, but you're not in a condition to receive it. Surgery is another option, but I don't think it would be in your best interest. The likelihood of benefit from surgery is small, and there's a good chance that you wouldn't be able to recover. patient: I don't understand. Why wouldn't surgery help? doctor: Because the tumor is so aggressive, it's likely to come back even after surgery. And the surgery itself is very risky. You could end up with more problems than you have now. patient: So what are my options? doctor: I'm afraid there aren't any good options. The best we can do is try to manage your symptoms and make you as comfortable as possible. patient: That's it? There's nothing else that can be done? doctor: I'm sorry, but that's the reality of the situation. patient: (Silence) doctor: I know this is a lot to take in. I'm here to answer any questions you have. patient: (Silence) doctor: I'm going to give you some information about malignant meningioma and the different treatment options. I'll also give you a referral to a palliative care specialist. They can help you manage your symptoms and provide support to you and your family. patient: Thank you. doctor: You're welcome. I'm here if you need anything else.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT New patient evaluation.

"doctor: Hello, I'm Dr. doctor's name. I understand you're here because your baby has been irritable and has had a fever for about 24 hours. Is that right? patient: Yes, that's right. He's been really fussy and crying a lot. He's also been vomiting a little bit. doctor: I see. And when did this all start? patient: It started about 48 hours ago. He was doing fine before that. doctor: Okay. And has he had any other symptoms, like diarrhea or a rash? patient: No, just the fever, fussiness, and vomiting. doctor: I see. Well, I'm going to examine him now and then we'll talk about what might be causing these symptoms. (The doctor examines the baby.) doctor: His vital signs are stable, but he is febrile at 101 degrees. His anterior fontanelle is not bulging. His neck is supple, with no nuchal rigidity. His heart rate is rapid, but there's no murmur. His lungs are clear. His abdomen is without mass, distention, or visceromegaly. His extremities are normal. He does have a skin pattern of cutis marmorata, which is a bit more exaggerated since he's febrile and has some peripheral vasodilatation. patient: What does that mean? doctor: Cutis marmorata is a harmless skin condition that causes a mottled, reddish-blue pattern on the skin. It's common in newborns and usually goes away on its own. patient: Okay. doctor: Well, based on my examination and your description of his symptoms, I think it's likely that he has a viral syndrome, such as viral meningitis or the flu. We'll need to do some tests to confirm the diagnosis, but in the meantime, we'll start him on supportive care, including IV fluids and Tylenol for his fever. We'll also continue the antibiotics until his spinal fluid cultures and blood cultures are negative for 48 hours. patient: Okay. doctor: I know this is a lot to take in, but I want to assure you that we're doing everything we can to help your baby. We'll keep you updated on his progress. patient: Thank you.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Fever, fussiness, and vomiting in a 2-day-old baby.

"doctor: Hello, Mr./Ms. patient, thank you for coming in today. I understand you're here for complaints of low back and right thigh pain. patient: That's right, doctor. It's been going on for a while now, and it's really starting to affect my daily life. doctor: I see. Can you tell me a little bit more about the pain? Where exactly do you feel it, and how would you describe it? patient: It's mostly in my lower back, between L4 and the sacrum. It's a sharp, stabbing pain that sometimes radiates down my right thigh. It's been especially bad lately, and I've been having trouble sleeping and working. doctor: I understand. Have you seen a doctor about this before? patient: Yes, I was seen in your clinic on 04/12/05. I was prescribed a Medrol Dosepak, and it helped reduce the pain a bit. But it's still there, and it's still interfering with my life. doctor: I see. Well, let's take a look at your back and see if we can find anything that might be causing the pain. The doctor performs a physical examination of the patient's back. doctor: Your range of motion is limited, and you're tender to palpation. There's no overt muscular spasm, and your reflexes are symmetric. patient: So what does that mean? doctor: Well, it means that there's something going on in your back that's causing the pain. It could be a herniated disc, or it could be something else. We'll need to do some more tests to figure it out. patient: What kind of tests? doctor: We'll start with an MRI. That will give us a detailed look at your spine and help us see what's causing the pain. patient: Okay. And what happens after that? doctor: Once we know what's causing the pain, we can start treating it. We may need to prescribe medication, or we may need to do surgery. But we'll take it one step at a time. patient: I'm glad to hear that. I'm ready to do whatever it takes to get rid of this pain. doctor: I'm glad to hear that. We'll work together to get you feeling better. The doctor and patient discuss the patient's medical history, including his previous back surgeries and his current medications. doctor: Okay, Mr./Ms. patient, I've reviewed your medical history and your test results. I've also examined your back. I believe that you have a herniated disc at L4-L5. This is a condition in which the soft, jelly-like center of an intervertebral disc pushes through the tough outer layer of the disc. This can cause pain, numbness, and weakness in the back and legs. patient: So what can we do about it? doctor: There are a few different treatment options for a herniated disc. We can start with conservative treatment, such as physical therapy and pain medication. If that doesn't help, we may need to consider surgery. patient: I'm not sure I want to have surgery. doctor: I understand. Surgery is always a last resort. But if conservative treatment doesn't help, it may be the best option for you. patient: I'll think about it. doctor: Okay. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a new pain medication. I'm also going to refer you to a physical therapist. patient: Thank you, doctor. doctor: You're welcome. I'm here to help.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Low back and right thigh pain.

It's especially bad when I kneel down. doctor: I see. Have you had any x-rays done on your knee before? patient: Yes, I had one done in 1999. They said there was some narrowing of the weightbearing joint and some minor hypertrophic spurring medially. doctor: Okay. I'm going to order a new x-ray today to see if there have been any changes. patient: Thank you. doctor: Now, let's talk about the rectal bleeding. How often does it happen? patient: It's been happening off and on for a while. It's usually bright red, and it sometimes drips into the toilet. doctor: Do you notice any other symptoms, like abdominal pain or changes in your bowel movements? patient: I do have some diffuse abdominal pain off and on. My stools are sometimes hard and sometimes runny. The blood doesn't seem to be related to a hard stool. doctor: I see. I'm concerned about the rectal bleeding, especially given your family history of colon cancer. I'm going to refer you to Dr. XYZ, a gastroenterologist, for further evaluation. patient: Okay. doctor: I'm also going to order some blood tests today, including a fasting blood sugar, chem-12, lipid profile, and CPK. I'll have the results mailed to you. patient: Thank you. doctor: You're welcome. I'd also like to talk to you about your weight gain. You've gained a significant amount of weight over the past few years, and this is putting you at risk for a number of health problems, including heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. patient: I know. I've been trying to lose weight, but it's been hard. doctor: I understand. I'm going to give you some tips on how to lose weight and I'd like to see you back in the office in six months to check on your progress. patient: Okay. I'll do that. doctor: Good. I'm also going to refer you for a sleep study. You've told me that you've been waking up suddenly in the middle of the night and that you snore. These are both symptoms of sleep apnea. patient: I didn't know that. doctor: Sleep apnea is a serious condition that can lead to heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. I think it's important to rule this out. patient: Okay. I'll do it. doctor: Good. I'm glad to hear that. I'm going to send you a prescription for a low-dose aspirin. This will help to reduce your risk of heart attack and stroke. patient: Thank you. doctor: You're welcome. I'm also going to send you a referral for a mammogram. You're due for one. patient: Okay. I'll schedule it. doctor: Good. I'm glad we were able to talk about all of these things today. I think we're making a good plan for your health. patient: Thank you. I appreciate it.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Left knee pain and rectal bleeding.

"doctor: Good morning, patient. I understand you're here today for a follow-up appointment regarding your septal perforation. patient: That's right. I'm still having some discomfort in my nose. It feels like a ""stretching"" pressure, and my nose is frequently dry. I also occasionally get nosebleeds. doctor: I see. Can you tell me a little more about the discomfort you're experiencing? patient: Well, it's hard to describe. It's like a burning or stinging sensation. And it's worse when I'm in dry environments. doctor: I understand. And you mentioned that you're using saline nasal wash 2-3 times daily. Is that helping at all? patient: It helps a little, but it doesn't completely relieve the discomfort. doctor: I see. Well, I've examined your nose and I can see that you have a large septal perforation in the anterior 2/3rd of the septum. It appears to be well healed, but it's likely the cause of your symptoms. patient: So what can I do about it? doctor: Well, there are a few options. One option is surgery to repair the perforation. However, this is a major surgery with a long recovery time. Another option is to continue using the saline nasal wash and to apply Bactroban ointment to the nose if there is occasional irritation or crusting. patient: I'm not sure I'm ready for surgery. Is there anything else I can do? doctor: Well, we can try some other treatments first. We can try using a humidifier in your bedroom at night. This can help to keep the air moist and reduce dryness. We can also try using a nasal spray that contains saline or a corticosteroid. patient: Okay, I'll try those things. doctor: Good. I'll see you back in 3 weeks to see how you're doing. If the treatments we've discussed don't help, we can talk about surgery again. patient: Thank you, doctor.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Follow-up appointment for septal perforation.

"doctor: Hello Mrs./Ms. patient, thank you for coming in today. I understand you're here because of some back pain and right leg pain. Can you tell me a little bit more about that? patient: Sure. I've been having back pain and right leg pain for about two years now. It started after I was diagnosed with small cell lung cancer. The cancer has spread to my femurs, lower lumbar spine, and pelvis. doctor: I see. So, the pain started after your cancer diagnosis and has been ongoing since then? patient: Yes, that's right. I've had numerous chemotherapy and radiation treatments, but the pain hasn't gone away. I just finished a series of 10 radiation treatments for pain relief, but it didn't help much. doctor: I understand. Can you describe the pain in more detail? Where exactly do you feel it, and what does it feel like? patient: The pain is mostly in my low back on the right side. It radiates down the back of my right leg to my knee. I also have some numbness in the bottom of my left foot, and some sharp pain in the left foot at times. The pain is sharp, dull, and aching. It's a 10 out of 10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst possible pain. doctor: Okay, and what makes the pain worse or better? patient: It seems to be worse while sitting in the car for a long time, standing, or walking. doctor: I see. And what medications are you taking for the pain? patient: I'm on Duragesic patch 250 mcg total, Celebrex 200 mg once daily, iron 240 mg twice daily, Paxil 20 mg daily, and Percocet. I don't know the strength of the Percocet, but I take up to eight a day. I'm also on warfarin 1 mg daily to keep my chest port patent, and Neurontin 300 mg three times daily. doctor: Okay, I've made a note of all that. I'd like to do a physical exam now to get a better understanding of your condition. doctor: (performs physical exam) doctor: Based on my examination and your history, I think you have a symptomatic facet and sacroiliac joint syndrome on the right. This is likely causing your back pain and right leg pain. I'd like to inject your right sacroiliac and facet joints under fluoroscopy today. This is a minimally invasive procedure that can help relieve your pain. patient: Okay, I'm willing to try that. doctor: Great. I'll explain the procedure in more detail and get your consent. I'll also ask for a stat protime today since you're on warfarin. We generally don't perform injections while patients are on warfarin, but since you're on a very small dose and have had previous biopsies while on it without any complications, we should be okay. patient: That sounds good. doctor: I've also asked that you stop taking Paxil and start taking Cymbalta instead. Cymbalta is a medication that can help with both depression and pain. I've also asked for an x-ray of your lumbar spine for further evaluation. patient: Okay, I'll do all of that. doctor: Great. I'll see you back in the clinic on Tuesday to follow up. In the meantime, if your pain continues or worsens, you can put on an extra 50 mcg patch and take a couple of extra Percocet if needed. patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Back pain and right leg pain.

"doctor: Good morning, Mrs. patient's name. Thank you for coming in today. I understand you've been experiencing some confusion and had a stroke. patient: Yes, that's right. I'm not sure why I'm here, but I had a stroke. doctor: I see. Well, let's start by going over your medical history. You have a history of coronary artery disease and had bypass grafting surgery in the past. Do you remember when and where that was? patient: I'm not sure. I don't remember much about it. doctor: That's okay. We can look that up in your chart. It also says here that you have carotid artery stenosis and had right carotid artery stenting. Again, do you recall when that was? patient: No, I don't remember that either. doctor: No problem. Additionally, you have diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a history of stroke with left-sided hemiplegia. patient: Yes, I remember having a stroke. doctor: I understand. Now, let's talk about your current symptoms. You mentioned confusion. Can you tell me more about that? patient: Well, I've been feeling disoriented and forgetful. I also had trouble speaking and understanding others. doctor: I see. And have you experienced any chest discomfort, shortness of breath, or palpitations? patient: No, I haven't had any of those symptoms. doctor: That's good to hear. I've reviewed your EKG and telemetry results. It shows that you have atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. However, your current telemetry shows normal sinus rhythm. patient: What does that mean? doctor: Atrial fibrillation is a heart rhythm disorder where the upper chambers of your heart (the atria) beat irregularly and rapidly. This can lead to a rapid heart rate and an increased risk of stroke. patient: That sounds serious. doctor: It can be, but we're going to take steps to manage it. I've consulted with cardiology, and we recommend starting you on Coumadin to prevent further strokes. However, given your current neurological status, we need to assess your risk of falling. If the risk is low, we'll proceed with Coumadin. Otherwise, we'll consider aspirin and Plavix. patient: I understand. doctor: Additionally, you have carotid artery stenosis. We'll order a CT angio of the carotid to assess stent patency. However, given your recent stroke, revascularization is not indicated at this time. patient: Okay. doctor: Finally, you have coronary artery disease, but you're clinically stable. We'll monitor that closely. patient: Thank you for explaining everything to me. doctor: You're welcome. We'll continue to monitor your condition and make any necessary adjustments to your treatment plan.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Confusion and history of stroke. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a pleasant age-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of confusion and history of stroke. The patient reports feeling disoriented and forgetful. She also had trouble speaking and understanding others. She denies chest discomfort, shortness of breath, or palpitations. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and had bypass grafting surgery in the past. She also has carotid artery stenosis and had right carotid artery stenting. Additionally, she has diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a history of stroke with left-sided hemiplegia. The patient's EKG and telemetry results show atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. However, her current telemetry shows normal sinus rhythm. The patient has carotid artery stenosis.

However, given her current neurological status, the risk of falling will be assessed. If the risk is low, Coumadin will be initiated. Otherwise, aspirin and Plavix will be considered. The patient will be monitored closely for her coronary artery disease. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response Assessment: Atrial fibrillation is a heart rhythm disorder where the upper chambers of the patient's heart (the atria) beat irregularly and rapidly. This can lead to a rapid heart rate and an increased risk of stroke. The patient has a history of stroke, which is a risk factor for developing atrial fibrillation. Plan: - Will consult cardiology. - Will assess patient's risk of falling. - If risk is low, will start Coumadin. If risk is high, will consider aspirin and Plavix. 2. Carotid artery stenosis Assessment: Carotid artery stenosis is a narrowing of the carotid arteries, which are the main arteries that supply blood to the brain. This can increase the risk of stroke. The patient had right carotid artery stenting in the past, but the patency of the stent is unknown. Plan: - Will order CT angio of the carotid to assess stent patency. 3. Coronary artery disease Assessment: Coronary artery disease is a narrowing of the arteries that supply blood to the heart. This can lead to chest pain, shortness of breath, and heart attacks. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and had bypass grafting surgery in the past. He is currently clinically stable. Plan: - Will monitor the patient's condition closely. 4. Left-sided hemiplegia Assessment: Left-sided hemiplegia is a weakness or paralysis of the left side of the body. This is a result of the patient's previous stroke. Plan: - Will continue to monitor the patient's neurological status. - Will provide rehabilitation as needed.

Your white cell count is slightly elevated, and your hematocrit is a bit low. Your serum sodium and potassium levels are normal, but your chloride and bicarb levels are slightly low. Your glucose level is elevated, and your BUN and creatinine levels are elevated as well. Your calcium level is normal, and your uric acid level was elevated yesterday. Your sed rate is elevated, and your BNP is also elevated. Your urinalysis showed white cells, protein, blood, and red blood cells. patient: What does all that mean? doctor: Well, it means that you have a urinary tract infection, an acute gouty attack, diabetes mellitus with diabetic nephropathy, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and peripheral vascular disease. Your chronic kidney disease is also at stage 4. patient: That's a lot to take in. doctor: I know it can be overwhelming, but we're going to work together to manage your conditions and help you feel better. I agree with the treatment plan that was started in the emergency room. We're going to add allopurinol to your medication regimen to help prevent future gout attacks. We're also going to discontinue Micardis and increase your Lasix dosage to help manage your blood pressure and fluid retention.

"doctor: Hello, Gregory. I understand you're here for ongoing management of your neuroblastoma. How have you been doing since your last visit? patient (Gregory's mother): He's been doing okay. He had a couple of days of nasal congestion, but it's improving now. He hasn't had any fevers, but his appetite has been a little diminished. He's peeing and pooping normally and hasn't had any diarrhea. He did have thrush recently, but we restarted him on fluconazole and it seems to be clearing up. doctor: I'm glad to hear that.

What's your current chemotherapy regimen? patient (Gregory's mother): He last received carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin on May 21st. He received G-CSF daily after his chemotherapy due to neutropenia, which delayed his second cycle. doctor: I see. Well, I'm happy to hear that your ANC has recovered nicely.

I'm pleased that the clinical evidence of disease appears to have resolved. And for the resolving neutropenia, it's okay to discontinue the G-CSF at this time. We'll plan for you to resume G-CSF after your next chemotherapy. patient (Gregory's mother): Got it. doctor: I've also sent a prescription for the G-CSF to your pharmacy.

"doctor: Hello, Ms. patient, thank you for coming in today. I understand you've been experiencing some difficult headaches, tunnel vision, and dizziness. patient: Yes, that's right. I've been having these headaches since I was 25 years old. They're pulsating and sometimes I get ""zig-zag lines"" in my vision. I also have photophobia and dizziness, which is mostly lightheadedness. On one occasion I almost had a syncope. doctor: I see. And how often do these headaches occur? patient: They've become more frequent lately, and now occur on average once to twice per week. They last about two hours, but I take papaverine which stops the symptoms within 30 minutes. doctor: I see. Have you seen a doctor about this before? patient: Yes, I've seen several doctors in the past. In 1996, when my husband died, my headaches became more frequent. I was given papaverine, which helped reduce the severity of my symptoms. After six months of taking papaverine, I no longer had any headaches. But in 2004, they returned.

Unfortunately, your prognosis is not good. Your AIDS is very advanced, and the opportunistic infections are taking a toll on your body. We can try to manage your symptoms and make you more comfortable, but there's no cure. patient: (Visibly upset) I don't know what to say. I just don't want to die. doctor: I know this is a lot to take in. We're here to support you and help you through this.

"doctor: Hello Mr./Ms. patient, how are you doing today? patient: I'm not feeling well. I've been having severe shortness of breath for the past few days. I've also been coughing up a lot of mucus. doctor: I see. How long have you been experiencing these symptoms? patient: About a week. I've tried using my nebulizer at home, but it hasn't helped much. doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Let me take a look at your lungs. doctor (after examining the patient's lungs): Your lungs sound congested. I'm going to order a chest x-ray to get a better look. doctor (after reviewing the chest x-ray): The x-ray shows that you have pneumonia. This is an infection of the lungs. It's likely caused by bacteria that you inhaled. patient: Pneumonia? Oh no. Is it serious? doctor: It can be, but we're going to start you on antibiotics right away. I'm also going to give you some oxygen to help you breathe. patient: Thank you. doctor: You're welcome. I'm also going to order some blood tests to check for other infections. doctor (after reviewing the blood test results): Your blood tests show that you have a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This is a condition in which your body's immune system is overreacting to the infection. It can lead to organ damage if it's not treated. patient: What does that mean? doctor: It means that we need to give you some medications to help reduce the inflammation. I'm also going to start you on a course of steroids. patient: Okay. doctor: I'm also going to order a swallow study to see if you have any problems swallowing. This could be contributing to your pneumonia. patient: Sure. doctor: I'm going to keep you in the hospital for a few days so we can monitor your condition and make sure that you're responding to treatment. patient: Okay. doctor: I'll be back to check on you later. doctor (a few days later): You're doing much better. Your pneumonia is clearing up and your inflammation is under control. I'm going to discharge you from the hospital today. patient: That's great news! doctor: I'm glad to hear that.

I'm going to order some tests to help us figure out what's causing your symptoms. patient: What kind of tests? doctor: I'm going to order an electrocardiogram (ECG) to look at your heart rhythm, a chest X-ray to look at your lungs, and some blood tests to check your blood sugar and cholesterol levels. I'd also like to have you do a stress test to see how your heart responds to exercise. patient: Okay. doctor: I'm also going to have you sign a release of records so that we can review your previous medical history. This will help us get a better understanding of your overall health. patient: Sure. doctor: I'm also concerned about your blood pressure. It's a little high today.

"doctor: Good morning, Mrs. patient, thank you for coming in today. I understand you're here for a dietary consultation. patient: Yes, that's right.

Can you tell me a little bit more about your current diet? patient: Well, I used to cook for large portions, but now that it's just the two of us, I'm having a hard time adjusting to preparing food for only two people.

I'm a bit nervous about that, too. doctor: Well, let's see what we can do to help you. First, I'm going to take some measurements.

Your basal energy expenditure is estimated at 1361 calories a day, and your total calorie requirement for weight maintenance is estimated at 1759 calories a day. patient: So what does that mean for me? doctor: It means that you need to reduce your calorie intake by 500 calories per day in order to lose one pound of weight per week. This translates into a 1200-calorie meal plan. patient: That seems like a lot. doctor: I know it may seem like a lot, but it's important to make gradual and sustainable changes to your diet. We can work together to find a meal plan that works for you and your lifestyle. patient: Okay. What kinds of foods should I be eating? doctor: I recommend that you focus on eating low-saturated fat sources with moderate amounts of sodium. You should also try to get a fruit or a vegetable at most meals. You can also have moderate portions of potatoes, pasta, and even breading your meat as long as you prepare it in a low-fat fashion. patient: That sounds doable. doctor: I'm also going to recommend that you increase the intensity and duration of your physical activity. Aim for 30 minutes of brisk walking five days a week. patient: I can do that. doctor: Great. I'm also going to encourage you to keep food records in order to better track calories consumed. This will help you stay on track with your weight loss goals. patient: I'll do that. doctor: I'm confident that you can reach your weight loss goals. Just remember to make gradual and sustainable changes to your diet and lifestyle. patient: Thank you for your help. I appreciate it. doctor: You're welcome. I'm here to help.

"doctor: Good morning, Mrs. patient's name. How are you feeling today? patient: I'm not feeling so good, doctor. I've been having this dizziness for a month now, and it's really starting to affect my life. doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about the dizziness? patient: Well, it started about a month ago. I was just getting out of bed one morning, and suddenly I felt like the room was spinning. I had to sit back down and stay in one place for several minutes before it went away. doctor: And has it been happening ever since? patient: Yes, it's been happening almost every day. It usually happens when I get up from bed or a chair, or when I roll over in bed. It also happens sometimes when I look up. doctor: Do you feel like you're going to pass out? patient: Sometimes. It's like I'm going to faint, but then it goes away. doctor: And do you have any other symptoms, like fever, chills, earache, or vision problems? patient: No, I don't have any other symptoms. doctor: Okay. I'm going to examine you now. (The doctor performs a physical examination.) doctor: Your blood pressure is a little high, but otherwise your vital signs are normal. Your heart and lungs sound good. I'm going to do a neurological exam now. (The doctor performs a neurological exam.) doctor: Your cranial nerves are intact, and your motor and sensory function is normal. However, I did notice that you have some difficulty with your balance and coordination. patient: Yes, I've been having trouble walking lately. I use a walker to get around. doctor: I see. Well, based on your symptoms and the results of my exam, I think you may have a condition called benign positional vertigo (BPPV). BPPV is a common cause of dizziness, and it's usually caused by a problem with the inner ear. patient: What can I do about it? doctor: There are a few things we can do. First, I'm going to prescribe you a medication called Antivert. This medication can help to reduce the dizziness. I'm also going to schedule you for some tests, including a CT scan of your head and an ENG test. These tests will help us to confirm the diagnosis of BPPV and rule out other possible causes of your dizziness. patient: Okay. doctor: I'm also going to recommend that you see a physical therapist. A physical therapist can teach you some exercises that can help to improve your balance and coordination. patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help. doctor: You're welcome. I'm here to help.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Dizziness. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a pleasant age-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of dizziness.

"doctor: Good morning, Mr. patient, thank you for coming in today. I understand you've been experiencing some heart failure symptoms. Can you tell me more about what you've been feeling? patient: Well, I've been feeling generally okay, but I've been stressed and fatigued. I work hard running three companies, and I've noticed shortness of breath with exertion and occasional shortness of breath at rest. I've also had some PND, but I sleep on one pillow. I don't have any edema now, but I've had some mild leg swelling in the past. I've never had any angina, palpitations, syncope, or near syncope. When I take my pulse, I notice some irregularity. I don't follow any special diet and I don't get regular exercise, although I've recently started walking for half an hour a day. Over the past year, these symptoms have been slowly getting worse. I've also gained about 20 pounds. doctor: I see. Do you have any history of heart failure or other heart problems? patient: No, I don't. doctor: What about your past medical history? Any notable conditions or surgeries? patient: I had a right inguinal hernia repair in 1982 and trauma to my right thumb. I don't have a history of high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, or heart murmur. doctor: Okay. Now, let's talk about your social history. Where do you live, and who do you live with? patient: I live in San Salvador with my wife. I have a lot of stress in my life. I don't smoke, but I do drink. I have a high school education. doctor: And your family history? Any heart conditions or other significant illnesses? patient: My mother is alive at age 89. My father died at 72 of a heart attack. I have two brothers and one sister, all of whom are healthy, although my oldest brother suffered a myocardial infarction. I have three healthy girls and nine healthy grandchildren. doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. I'm going to perform a comprehensive cardiovascular examination now. The doctor performs the examination. doctor: Based on my examination, I've noted a few findings. Your blood pressure is 120/70 in each arm seated, your pulse is 80 beats per minute and regular, and your breathing is 12 times per minute and unlabored. Your heart rhythm is regular, and your first and second heart sounds are normal. However, you do have a fourth heart sound and a soft systolic murmur. Your precordial impulse is enlarged. Your lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion, and your abdomen is soft without hepatosplenomegaly or masses. You don't have any clubbing, cyanosis, or peripheral edema. Your distal pulses are normal throughout both arms and both legs. Neurologically, your mentation, mood, and affect are normal, and you're oriented to person, place, and time. doctor: I've also reviewed your test results. Your EKG shows sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy, and your metabolic stress test indicates mild cardiopulmonary disease. Your laboratory data shows normal TSH, glucose, creatinine, potassium, and hematocrit. Your urinalysis was also normal. I've also reviewed your echocardiogram, which shows a dilated cardiomyopathy with an EF of 15% and a left ventricular diastolic dimension of 6.8 cm. There are no significant valvular abnormalities. Your stress thallium showed no scintigraphic evidence of stress-induced myocardial ischemia, but there is a fixed small-sized mild-to-moderate intensity perfusion defect in the distal inferior wall and apex, which may be an old infarct. doctor: Based on all of this information, it appears that you have a newly diagnosed dilated cardiomyopathy. The etiology of this is uncertain, but there is a strong genetic component. We'll need to do some family screening to make sure your siblings and children haven't developed the same condition. patient: What does this mean for me? doctor: Well, we'll need to start you on some medications to help manage your condition. I'm going to prescribe an ACE inhibitor, lisinopril, and a beta-blocker, carvedilol. We'll start with low doses and gradually increase them over the next few weeks. I'll also recommend that you start taking a loop diuretic, such as furosemide, to help reduce fluid retention. In addition, you should make some lifestyle changes, such as eating a healthy diet, getting regular exercise, and managing your stress. patient: I'll do whatever it takes to get better. doctor: I'm confident that we can help you manage your condition and improve your quality of life. I'll see you again in 3 to 6 months to check on your progress. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to call my office.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Heart failure symptoms.

"doctor: Hello, patient. I'm Dr. doctor, and I'll be your physician today. I understand you've been experiencing some medical issues lately. Can you tell me a little bit about what's been going on? patient: Well, I had a large stroke last night that affected the right side of my brain. I was started on a study drug that's similar to TPA, but then I had another stroke on the opposite side of my brain. The doctors think it's cardioembolic and not related to the study drug. doctor: I see. That sounds very concerning. What were your symptoms like during the strokes? patient: During the first stroke, I felt weakness and numbness on the left side of my body. I also had trouble speaking and understanding speech. During the second stroke, I lost consciousness and had to be intubated and paralyzed. doctor: I understand. And how are you feeling now? patient: I'm still feeling very weak and confused. I'm also having trouble breathing on my own. doctor: I see. Well, I've reviewed your medical records and I've spoken with Dr. A. We're still trying to determine the exact cause of your strokes, but we're working on it. In the meantime, we're going to start you on some medications to help manage your blood pressure and heart rate. We're also going to do some tests to look for any underlying conditions that may have contributed to the strokes. patient: Okay. What kind of tests will you be doing? doctor: We're going to do a STAT echocardiogram to look for any clots in your heart or a patent foramen ovale. We're also going to do an ultrasound of your leg to look for any blood clots there. patient: I see. And what about my medications? doctor: We're going to start you on a Cardizem drip to control your blood pressure and heart rate. We're also going to give you Digoxin to help regulate your heart rhythm. And we're going to start you on a low dose of tube feeds to make sure you're getting the nutrients you need. patient: Okay. Thank you for explaining everything to me. doctor: You're welcome. I know this is a lot to take in, but we're going to do everything we can to help you get better. patient: I appreciate that. doctor: You're welcome. We'll keep you updated on your condition as we learn more.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Left-sided weakness, dysphasia, and confusion. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a pleasant age-year-old male who presents to the hospital following two strokes. He reports that the first stroke occurred last night and affected the right side of his brain. Symptoms included left-sided weakness, numbness, and difficulty with speech and language comprehension. He was started on a study drug similar to TPA but subsequently experienced a second stroke on the opposite side of his brain. The patient lost consciousness and required intubation and paralysis. He denies any recent changes in his hearing. He continues to take niacin for his dyslipidemia and has had no problems with hemorrhoids in the last 6 months. He also denies any problems with concha bullosa of the left nostril or septal deviation. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1.

"Doctor: Hello patient, I see you're here for a prenatal checkup. How are you feeling today? Patient: I'm doing okay, but I've been having some contractions every ten minutes. I also lost my mucous plug. Doctor: I see. And have you noticed any other symptoms, like leaking fluid or spotting? Patient: Yes, I did have some spotting. Doctor: Okay, I'm going to examine you now to check on your progress. Doctor: (After examining the patient) You're 4 cm dilated, 70% effaced, and -3 station. This is a change from your last office exam, where you were 1 cm to 2 cm dilated. Patient: Oh, okay. So, what does that mean? Doctor: It means that your labor is progressing. We'll admit you to the Labor and Delivery unit for monitoring and management. We'll also perform an AROM (artificial rupture of membranes) to help speed up the labor process. Patient: Okay. Doctor: (After performing AROM) Your amniotic fluid is meconium stained. This means that your baby has passed stool in the womb. We'll need to monitor your baby closely to make sure they're doing okay. Patient: Okay. Doctor: (After several hours of labor) Your contractions are now coming every two to three minutes and are more intense. We'll give you some Nubain to help with the pain. Patient: Thank you. Doctor: (After the patient has given birth) You've delivered a healthy baby girl! She weighs 2870 grams and is 51 cm long. Her Apgars were 6 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes. There was initial neonatal depression, but she responded well to treatment. Patient: Oh, I'm so happy! Can I see her? Doctor: Of course. The pediatrician will bring her to you shortly. Doctor: (After examining the patient post-delivery) Your placenta has delivered intact with a three-vessel cord. There are no perineal abrasions or lacerations. On vaginal exam, there are no cervical or vaginal sidewall lacerations. Estimated blood loss was less than 250 cc. You and your baby are doing well. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I'm so relieved.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Prenatal checkup. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a pleasant age-year-old female who presents for a prenatal checkup.

On vaginal exam, there are no cervical or vaginal sidewall lacerations. Estimated blood loss was less than 250 cc. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. Active labor Assessment: The patient is 4 cm dilated, 70% effaced, and -3 station with contractions every 2-3 minutes. Her amniotic fluid is meconium stained, indicating that the baby has passed stool in the womb. Plan: - Admit the patient to the Labor and Delivery unit for monitoring and management. - Perform AROM to help speed up the labor process. - Administer Nubain for pain management. - Monitor the baby closely to ensure their well-being. 2. Meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) Assessment: The baby's amniotic fluid was meconium stained, increasing the risk of MAS. Plan: - Monitor the baby closely for signs of MAS, such as respiratory distress, tachypnea, and cyanosis. - Provide supportive care, such as oxygen therapy and suctioning, if necessary. 3.

I understand you're here for your initial obstetrical examination. patient: Yes, that's right. doctor: Can you tell me a little bit about your pregnancy? patient: Well, I took a home pregnancy test and it was positive. I'm not sure how far along I am, but my last menstrual period was on February 13th, 2002. doctor: Okay, so you're about 8 weeks pregnant. Have you been experiencing any symptoms? patient: Not really. I haven't felt any fetal activity yet, but I know that's normal this early on. doctor: That's right. Most women don't start feeling fetal movement until around 18 to 20 weeks. patient: I've also been having some trouble sleeping. doctor: Is there anything else that's been bothering you? patient: I've been feeling a little anxious. doctor: That's understandable. Pregnancy can be a very emotional time. patient: I know. I'm just trying to take it one day at a time. doctor: That's a good approach. I'm going to order some blood tests to make sure everything is progressing normally. I'd also like to do a Pap smear. patient: Okay. doctor: I'm also going to prescribe you some prenatal vitamins.

"doctor: Hello, Mr. Smith, it's good to see you again. How have you been doing since your last visit? patient: I've been doing quite well, doctor. I've had no symptoms of CAD or CHF. I followed up with Dr. X, and she thought I was doing well too. I've had no symptoms of high or low blood sugar. I haven't had any falls either. My right knee does pain me sometimes, though. I've been taking Tylenol for that. doctor: I see. And how is your memory and thinking? patient: My memory is clear, and my thinking is good. doctor: That's good to hear. Now, let's talk about your medications. You're still taking Bumex, aspirin, lisinopril, NPH insulin, Zocor, Toprol-XL, and Protonix, correct? patient: Yes, that's right. doctor: Okay. I'm going to have the nurse take your blood pressure and pulse. nurse takes blood pressure and pulse doctor: Your blood pressure is 140/78 and your pulse is 91 and regular. Your oxygen saturation is 94%. Your JVP is normal without HJR. Your lungs are clear to auscultation. Your heart sounds are S1 and S2 with an unchanged aortic murmur. Your abdomen is soft, non-tender without hepatosplenomegaly, and normal bowel sounds. Your extremities show no edema today. You're awake, alert, and attentive. You were able to get up on to the examination table and out of a chair with normal gait. You have bilateral OA changes of the knee. patient: Yes, my right knee has been bothering me. doctor: I see. Well, your creatinine is down to 1.7, which is an improvement from your last visit when it was 2.3. Your A1c is also improved, down to 7.6 from 8.5. Your total cholesterol is 192, your HDL is 37, and your triglycerides are 487. patient: What do you think about my triglycerides? doctor: Well, at your last visit, you had 3+ protein in your urine. Your TSH was normal. We're going to get a 24-hour urine to rule out nephrosis as the cause of your hypertriglyceridemia. In the meantime, Dr. X and I have been considering whether you should have an agent added to treat your hypertriglyceridemia. Specifically, we were considering TriCor (fenofibrate). However, given your history of high CPK values, we've decided not to do that for now. We'll leave that option open for the future. We'll also check a fasting lipid panel today. patient: Okay. doctor: Now, let's talk about your arthritis. You can use Extra Strength Tylenol up to 4 grams a day, but I suggest that you start with a regular dose of 1 to 2 to 3 grams per day. You can increase the dose gradually if needed. As for a brace, you mentioned that you've used one in the past and it didn't help much. I'm a little concerned about the tourniquet effect of a brace, which could increase your edema or put you at risk for venous thromboembolic disease. So, for now, you should continue using your cane and walker. patient: I'll do that. doctor: Finally, I'm going to give you a flu vaccination today. patient: Thank you. doctor: You're welcome. I'd like to see you back in 3 months. If you have any problems before then, please don't hesitate to call the office. patient: I will. Thank you, doctor.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Right knee pain.

"doctor: Good morning, Mr./Ms. Patient's name. I'm Dr. Doctor's name, and I'll be seeing you today. I understand you're here for a consultation regarding your neurogenic bladder and recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs). patient: That's right, doctor. doctor: Can you tell me a little bit about your current symptoms? patient: Well, I've been having intermittent self-catheterization three times a day, and I change my catheter weekly. Other than that, I'm not experiencing any dysuria, gross hematuria, fever, or chills. doctor: Okay. And when did your symptoms start? patient: I was seen in the ER on June 24th with fever, weakness, and possible urosepsis. I had a blood culture and urine culture done, and both came back positive for Staphylococcus epidermidis. I was treated with IV antibiotics and discharged home. I'm not taking any antibiotics now. doctor: I see. Do you have any history of kidney problems? patient: Yes, I had a renal transplant, which is being followed by Dr. X. I'm also on chronic steroids for that. doctor: Okay. And have you had any recent imaging studies done? patient: Yes, I had a renal ultrasound on June 23rd. It showed mild hydronephrosis of the renal transplant with fluid in the pericapsular space. doctor: I see. And what were your creatinine and BUN levels on July 7th? patient: My creatinine was 2.0 and my BUN was 36. Dr. X is following those levels. doctor: Okay. Well, based on your history and symptoms, I'm going to diagnose you with neurogenic bladder and recurrent UTI. The steroids you're taking for your renal transplant are likely suppressing your immune system and making you more susceptible to infections. patient: I see. So what do we do now? doctor: Well, we're going to continue with intermittent self-catheterization, and we'll change your catheter weekly. We'll also discuss the technique of catheterization again to make sure you're doing it correctly. patient: Okay. doctor: In addition, I'm going to prescribe Keflex nighttime prophylaxis for the next three months. This should help to prevent future UTIs. patient: Okay. doctor: I'd like you to follow up with me in September so we can reassess your condition. patient: Okay. doctor: In the meantime, if you have any concerns, please don't hesitate to call my office. patient: Thank you, doctor. doctor: You're welcome.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Consultation regarding neurogenic bladder and recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs).

"doctor: Good morning, Mrs. patient. I'm Dr. doctor, and I'll be your physician today. I understand you've been experiencing chest pain. Can you tell me more about that? patient: Well, I had some chest pain a while back, but it's gone away now. I'm not sure why I was sent to the hospital. doctor: I see. Well, the tests we've run show that you have severe aortic stenosis. That means the valve in your heart that controls blood flow to your body is narrowed. This can cause chest pain, shortness of breath, and fatigue. patient: Oh, I didn't know that. doctor: I understand that you're hesitant about having surgery, but it's important to weigh the risks and benefits. Without surgery, your aortic stenosis could get worse and lead to serious complications, including heart failure. patient: I know, but I'm afraid of surgery. I've had a lot of bad experiences with doctors in the past. doctor: I understand your concerns. I want to assure you that we'll do everything we can to make sure you're comfortable and safe. We'll also work with your psychiatrist to make sure your mental health is taken care of. patient: That would be helpful. doctor: I'm also concerned about your history of substance abuse. Inhalant abuse can cause a number of health problems, including brain damage. This may be contributing to your difficulty making decisions. patient: I know, I've been trying to get clean. doctor: That's good to hear. We can help you with that as well. patient: Thank you. doctor: You're welcome. I'm going to recommend that we do a cardiac catheterization to get a better look at your heart. This will help us determine the best course of treatment. patient: Okay. doctor: I'm also going to recommend that you see a psychiatrist regularly to help you manage your mental health. patient: I'll do that. doctor: Good. I'm glad we could have this conversation. I think we can work together to get you the care you need. patient: Thank you, Dr. doctor.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Chest pain.

"doctor: Hello, patient. I understand you're here today for foot pain? patient: Yes, that's right. I've been having pain in my foot for a while now, and it's been getting worse lately. doctor: Can you tell me more about the pain? Where exactly is it located? patient: It's on the top and lateral aspect of my foot, below my ankle. It's a sharp, stabbing pain that gets worse when I walk or exercise. doctor: Have you seen a doctor about this pain before? patient: Yes, I saw Dr. XYZ last week for back pain, and he prescribed me some pain medication and muscle relaxers. But I've been in here multiple times for different kinds of pain. doctor: I see. And have you had any recent injuries to your foot? patient: No, I haven't injured it recently. It's just been chronically painful. doctor: I understand. Well, let me take a look at your foot. doctor (after examining the patient's foot): Your foot looks okay.

It's possible that the hardware is causing some irritation or inflammation. patient: So, what can I do about it? doctor: Well, we can try some different things to see what helps. I'm going to prescribe you some Lortab 7.5 to help with the pain. I'm also going to refer you to a specialist who can evaluate your foot and determine if the hardware needs to be removed. patient: Okay, thank you. doctor: You're welcome. I hope this helps. patient: Me too. doctor: I also want to talk to you about your primary care physician. You've been seen here multiple times for pain, and it's important to have a regular doctor who can oversee your care. patient: I know, I've been trying to find one. I was supposed to see Dr. XYZ today, but they canceled my appointment because I don't have Project Access insurance yet. doctor: I see. Well, I'm glad to hear that Project Access will be approving your insurance next week. In the meantime, I'm going to keep your chart open so that we can follow up with you and make sure you're getting the care you need. patient: Thank you, I appreciate that. doctor: You're welcome.

"doctor: Good morning, patient. Thank you for coming in today. I understand you're here for a second opinion on your kyphosis. patient: That's right. I've been noticing a round back posture for a while now, and my parents took me to another orthopedist who recommended observation. I wanted to get a second opinion to see if there are any other treatment options. doctor: I see. Well, let's start with a few questions. Are you experiencing any pain in your back or any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your upper or lower extremities? patient: No, I don't have any pain or numbness. doctor: Okay. And have you had any problems with your bowels or bladder? patient: No, everything's been normal. doctor: That's good to hear. Now, I'm going to do a physical exam to get a better understanding of your condition. The doctor performs a physical exam, checking the patient's skin, muscles, and range of motion. doctor: Based on my exam, it appears that you have a mild kyphosis. Your skin is intact with no rashes or lesions, and there's no evidence of paraspinal muscle spasm. You have full strength in all muscle groups, and your sensation is intact to light touch. Your X-rays also showed a 46-degree kyphosis. patient: So, what does this mean? doctor: Well, kyphosis is a condition where the spine curves abnormally forward. In your case, the curve is mild and is likely within the normal range for an adolescent. However, we'll need to monitor it closely to make sure it doesn't progress. patient: What are my treatment options? doctor: There are three main options: observation, physical therapy, and bracing. Since your kyphosis is mild and you're still growing, we can start with observation and physical therapy. The physical therapy will focus on extension-based strengthening exercises, flexibility range of motion exercises, and postural training. We'll see you back in 3 months for repeat radiographs to assess your progress. If the kyphosis shows signs of progression, we may need to consider bracing. patient: Okay, I understand. doctor: I'm also going to give you a prescription for Ceftin to treat your ear infection. patient: Thank you. doctor: You're welcome. I'm confident that we can manage your kyphosis and help you achieve the best possible outcome.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Second opinion on kyphosis.

"doctor: Hello, how are you doing today? patient: I'm doing okay. I'm here for my first Pap smear and I also wanted to talk to you about my irregular periods. doctor: I see. Can you tell me more about your irregular periods? patient: Well, they've been really out of whack lately. Sometimes I'll go two weeks without a period, and then I'll bleed for two whole weeks. Usually, my periods last about seven days and start on the 19th of each month, but now it seems like they're changing. The cramping is also worse, and my flow has increased. I have to change my pad every half to one hour and sometimes I have to use a super tampon. I usually have four days of heavy flow and then about 10 days where I have to wear a mini pad. doctor: That sounds like it's been really difficult for you. I'm also concerned about your headaches. You mentioned that they've been getting worse lately. patient: Yes, they have. I've had a lot of stress lately and I've been getting headaches more frequently. They're usually migraines and they're really bad. I've tried avoiding caffeine and chocolate, and I only drink one can of cola a day, but it doesn't seem to help. doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. I'm going to order some tests to try to figure out what's causing your irregular periods and headaches. I'm also going to prescribe you some medication for the headaches. patient: Thank you. I appreciate it. doctor: You're welcome. I'll also talk to you about birth control pills as an option to regulate your periods and reduce the cramping and excessive flow. We'll discuss this further once we have the results of your tests. patient: Okay, thank you. doctor: You're welcome. I'll be back in a few minutes to go over the results of your tests.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Irregular periods and headaches.

His daughter reports that he had a similar episode of hematuria approximately one year ago. At that time, he was discharged from the emergency room after a workup and given Levaquin. However, he returned to the emergency department three days later with a large hematoma on his left neck and a coagulopathy with significant bleeding. His hemoglobin and hematocrit dropped to very low levels, and he received blood transfusions. He was diagnosed with a malignancy and a coagulopathy and was in critical condition. The patient was told that he might not survive. Fortunately, he pulled through. Since then, he has not had any bleeding until now. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. Gross hematuria Assessment: Patient presents with gross hematuria. He has a history of malignancy and coagulopathy. Differential diagnosis include malignancy recurrence, urinary tract infection, kidney stones, or bleeding disorder. Plan: - Admit patient to the hospital for monitoring and further workup. - Obtain urinalysis, complete blood count, and coagulation panel. - Consult with Dr. X and Dr. Y to discuss treatment plan. 2. History of malignancy Assessment: Patient has a history of malignancy and coagulopathy. He was diagnosed with a malignancy a year ago and was in critical condition. He has not had any bleeding until now. Plan: - Review pathology and imaging studies from previous malignancy workup. - Consider further imaging studies to evaluate for recurrence. 3. Coagulopathy Assessment: Patient has a history of coagulopathy. He developed a coagulopathy after an episode of hematuria a year ago. He received blood transfusions and was eventually discharged. Plan: - Review coagulation panel results. - Consider consultation with hematology for further evaluation and management.","[{'phrase': 'he mat uria', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'morning',

"doctor: Good morning, patient. I understand you're here for a second opinion regarding cataract extraction. patient: Yes, that's right. I've been told that I need cataract surgery in both eyes, but I'm nervous about having surgery. doctor: I can understand your concerns. Cataract surgery is a major surgery, and it's natural to be nervous. I'm here to answer any questions you have and help you make the best decision for your eyes. patient: Well, I've had laser surgery four times to the macula in my right eye and twice in my left eye. I see Dr. X for that. doctor: I see. Dr. X is a very good ophthalmologist. I'm sure he's given you excellent care. patient: He has. But I'm still worried about cataract surgery. I'm afraid it will make my vision worse. doctor: I can understand your concerns. However, I want to assure you that cataract surgery is a very safe and effective procedure. In most cases, it can significantly improve vision. patient: Really? doctor: Yes. Cataracts are a clouding of the lens of the eye. They can cause blurry vision, glare, and difficulty seeing at night. Cataract surgery removes the cloudy lens and replaces it with a clear artificial lens. This can often restore vision to near-normal levels. patient: That's encouraging. But what about my macular degeneration? doctor: Macular degeneration is a serious condition that can lead to vision loss. However, cataract surgery can actually help to slow the progression of macular degeneration. By removing the cataracts, we can improve the clarity of the images that reach the macula. This can help to preserve vision and prevent further damage. patient: That's good to know. I think I'm starting to feel a little better about cataract surgery. doctor: I'm glad to hear that. I know it's a big decision, but I'm confident that cataract surgery is the right choice for you. patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help. doctor: You're welcome.

"Doctor: Hello, Mrs. Patient, thank you for coming in today. I understand you're here for an evaluation of angina. Patient: That's right, doctor. I've been having this chest pain for the past few hours, and it's been getting worse. Doctor: I see. Can you describe the pain for me? Patient: It's a crushing pain in my chest. It started suddenly while I was exercising, and it's been radiating to my arm and jaw. I've also been feeling nauseous. Doctor: Okay, and how severe would you say the pain is? Patient: It's pretty severe. It's not getting any better, and it's starting to interfere with my daily activities. Doctor: I see. Do you have any known medical allergies? Patient: No, I don't. Doctor: And what medications are you currently taking? Patient: I'm taking Estraderm 0.05 mg/day transdermal patch. Doctor: Okay. Do you have any past medical history that I should be aware of? Patient: No, I don't. Doctor: Have you had any previous surgeries? Patient: No, I haven't. Doctor: Do you smoke or use tobacco products? Patient: Yes, I do. I've been smoking a pack a day for about 40 years. Doctor: Okay. Do you have any family history of heart disease? Patient: Yes, my father had a heart attack when he was in his 60s. Doctor: I see. Well, Mrs. Patient, based on your symptoms and medical history, I think it's likely that you're experiencing angina pectoris. This is a condition in which the blood flow to your heart is reduced, causing chest pain. Patient: What causes angina pectoris? Doctor: There are a number of things that can cause angina pectoris, including coronary artery disease, which is a narrowing of the arteries that supply blood to your heart. Smoking, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure are all risk factors for coronary artery disease. Patient: So, what can I do to treat my angina? Doctor: There are a number of things we can do. First, we need to get your risk factors under control. This means quitting smoking, lowering your cholesterol, and managing your blood pressure. We may also prescribe medication to help improve blood flow to your heart and reduce chest pain. Patient: Okay, I'll do whatever it takes to get better. Doctor: I'm glad to hear that. I'm going to order some tests to confirm the diagnosis and to rule out other potential causes of your chest pain. I'm also going to start you on a medication to help relieve your symptoms.

"doctor: Good afternoon, Mr. ABC. I'm Dr. doctor, and I'll be your cardiologist today. I understand you've been experiencing some chest pain. patient: Yes, that's right. I've been having chest pain for the past few weeks. It started out as a mild pain, but it's gotten worse over time. Now, it's severe and it comes on after just a few minutes of exercise. doctor: I see. And have you been experiencing any other symptoms, such as shortness of breath or lightheadedness? patient: No, not really. Just the chest pain. doctor: Okay. Well, I'd like to run a few tests to try to figure out what's causing your chest pain. We'll start with a stress test. patient: Sure. doctor: (After the stress test) Well, Mr. ABC, the stress test showed that you have severe chest pain after just 5 minutes of exercise. We also saw some horizontal ST depressions and moderate apical ischemia on the stress imaging. patient: What does that mean? doctor: It means that there's a blockage in your arteries that's preventing blood from flowing properly to your heart. This can cause chest pain and other symptoms. patient: Is it serious? doctor: It can be. If the blockage is severe, it can lead to a heart attack. That's why I'm recommending that we do a cardiac catheterization. patient: What's that? doctor: It's a procedure where we insert a thin tube into your artery and inject a dye that will help us see the blockage. patient: Okay. doctor: (After the cardiac catheterization) Well, Mr. ABC, the cardiac catheterization showed that you have mild-to-moderate left main distal disease, moderate proximal LAD with a severe mid-LAD lesion, and a mid-left circumflex lesion. patient: What does that mean? doctor: It means that you have a blockage in several of your arteries. The blockage in your left anterior descending artery is the most severe. This is the artery that supplies blood to the front of your heart. patient: So, what do we do now? doctor: I'm recommending that we transfer you to Medical Center for PCI. PCI is a procedure where we insert a stent into the artery to open up the blockage. patient: Okay. I'm agreeable with that. doctor: I've already spoken with Dr. X at Medical Center, and he has kindly accepted you in transfer. We'll send over your medical records and the CD ROM of your images. patient: Thank you, doctor. doctor: You're welcome.

"doctor: Good morning, patient. I understand you've been experiencing nausea and vomiting for the past week. Can you tell me more about that? patient: Yes, doctor. It started about a week ago. I've been having nausea and vomiting at least once a day, sometimes more. It can happen at any time, but it's often after I eat. I vomit up a dark brown-to-green fluid, but there's been no blood. doctor: I see. Have you been able to keep anything down? patient: Not much. My appetite has been poor, so I haven't been eating much. I've lost about 40 pounds in the past 16 months. doctor: That's a significant amount of weight loss. Have you noticed any other symptoms? patient: Yes, I've been getting severe heartburn for the past few days. I tried taking Tums, but it didn't help. I don't have any difficulty swallowing or pain when I swallow. I also haven't had any abdominal pain, diarrhea, rectal bleeding, or black stools. doctor: Okay. Do you have a history of any gastrointestinal problems? patient: I do have a history of chronic constipation, but I usually have a bowel movement every 3 to 4 days. That hasn't changed recently. I've never had an endoscopy or barium studies of my GI tract. doctor: I see. Now, I understand you have some medical conditions. Can you tell me more about those? patient: I have metastatic breast cancer that has spread to my rib cage and spine. I'm currently receiving hormonal chemotherapy for that and I'm under the care of an oncologist. I also have acute renal failure. doctor: Okay. I'll make sure to note that in your chart. Are you taking any medications for these conditions? patient: Yes, I take Zofran, Protonix, a fentanyl patch, Synthroid, Ativan, and Ambien. doctor: Thank you for that information. Now, let's talk about your family history. Do you have any family members with a history of colon cancer or polyps? patient: No, I don't. My father died of mesothelioma, and my mother died of Hodgkin lymphoma. doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Now, let's do a physical exam. The doctor performs a physical exam, noting the patient's vital signs, skin appearance, lymph nodes, eyes, neck, heart, lungs, abdomen, and neurological status. doctor: Based on your symptoms and the physical exam, I think we need to run some tests to get a better understanding of what's going on. We'll start with a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and an abdominal X-ray. I'd also like to order a total abdominal ultrasound to look for any evidence of liver metastasis or kidney problems. patient: Okay, I'll do whatever it takes to get better. doctor: That's great to hear. I'm also going to consult with your oncologist and a renal specialist to get their input on your care. patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help. doctor: You're welcome. I'll keep you updated on the results of your tests and we'll discuss the next steps in your treatment plan.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Nausea and vomiting. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a pleasant age-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of nausea and vomiting. The patient reports that she has been experiencing nausea and vomiting at least once a day for the past week, sometimes more. The emesis occurs at any time, but it is often after she eats. She vomits up a dark brown-to-green fluid, but there has been no blood. She reports that she has had poor appetite and has lost about 40 pounds in the past 16 months. The patient also reports severe heartburn for the past few days. She denies dysphagia, odynophagia, abdominal pain, diarrhea, rectal bleeding, or melena. She has a history of chronic constipation, but she usually has a bowel movement every 3 to 4 days. She denies any recent changes in bowel habits. She has never had an endoscopy or barium studies of her GI tract. She has metastatic breast cancer that has spread to her rib cage and spine. She is currently receiving hormonal chemotherapy for her breast cancer and is under the care of an oncologist. She also has acute renal failure. She takes Zofran, Protonix, a fentanyl patch, Synthroid, Ativan, and Ambien. Family history is negative for colon cancer or polyps. Her father died of mesothelioma, and her mother died of Hodgkin lymphoma. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. Nausea and vomiting with severe heartburn, weight loss, and history of chronic constipation Assessment: Symptoms are suggestive of upper gastrointestinal (GI) obstruction. The most likely cause is cancer progression with peritoneal metastasis, but other conditions such as peptic ulcer disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, or gastric outlet obstruction should be considered. Plan: - Order CBC, CMP, abdominal X-ray, and total abdominal ultrasound. - Consult with oncology and renal specialist. - Start IV fluids for hydration. - Consider placing a nasogastric tube for decompression if obstruction is confirmed. - Provide antiemetics as needed. - If cancer progression is confirmed, discuss palliative treatment options with the patient and family. 2. Metastatic breast cancer Assessment: Patient has known metastatic breast cancer involving rib cage and spine. She is currently receiving hormonal chemotherapy. Plan: - Continue hormonal chemotherapy as directed by oncologist. - Continue close monitoring for disease progression. 3. Acute renal failure Assessment: Patient has a history of acute renal failure. Plan: - Monitor renal function closely. - Consult with renal specialist for further management. Follow-up instructions: - Return to clinic in 1 week for follow-up and review of test results.","[{'phrase': 'nausea', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'vomiting', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'week', 'label': 'DURATION'}, {'phrase': 'week', 'label': 'DATE'}, {'phrase': 'vomiting', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'day', 'label': 'DURATION'}, {'phrase': '16 months', 'label': 'DURATION'}, {'phrase': 'severe', 'label': 'SEVERITY'}, {'phrase': 'heartburn', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'past few days', 'label': 'DURATION'}, {'phrase': 'Tum s', 'label': 'MEDICATION'}, {'phrase': 'difficulty swallowing', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'pain', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'swallow', 'label': 'DETAILED_DESCRIPTION'}, {'phrase': 'abdominal', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'pain', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'diarrhea', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'rectal', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'bleeding', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'black stools', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'gastrointestinal', 'label': 'DISEASE_DISORDER'}, {'phrase': 'chronic', 'label': 'DETAILED_DESCRIPTION'}, {'phrase': 'constipation', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'bowel movement', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': '3 to 4 days', 'label': 'DURATION'}, {'phrase': 'endoscopy', 'label': 'DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE'}, {'phrase': 'barium studies', 'label': 'DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE'}, {'phrase': 'GI tract', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'metastatic', 'label': 'DETAILED_DESCRIPTION'}, {'phrase': 'breast cancer', 'label': 'DISEASE_DISORDER'}, {'phrase': 'rib cage', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'spine', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'hormonal chemotherapy', 'label': 'MEDICATION'}, {'phrase': 'oncologist', 'label': 'THERAPEUTIC_PROCEDURE'}, {'phrase': 'acute', 'label': 'DETAILED_DESCRIPTION'}, {'phrase': 'renal failure', 'label': 'DISEASE_DISORDER'}, {'phrase': 'Zo fran', 'label': 'MEDICATION'}, {'phrase': 'Proton ix', 'label': 'MEDICATION'}, {'phrase': 'fentanyl patch', 'label': 'MEDICATION'}, {'phrase': 'Synthroid', 'label': 'MEDICATION'}, {'phrase': 'Ativan', 'label': 'MEDICATION'}, {'phrase': 'Ambien', 'label': 'MEDICATION'}, {'phrase': 'colon cancer polyps father died', 'label': 'FAMILY_HISTORY'}, {'phrase': 'mesothelioma', 'label': 'DISEASE_DISORDER'}, {'phrase': 'mother died', 'label': 'FAMILY_HISTORY'}, {'phrase': 'Hodgkin lymphoma', 'label': 'DISEASE_DISORDER'}, {'phrase': 'physical exam', 'label': 'DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE'}, {'phrase': 'physical exam', 'label': 'DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE'}, {'phrase': 'vital signs', 'label': 'DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE'}, {'phrase': 'skin appearance', 'label': 'DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE'}, {'phrase': 'lymph', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'nodes', 'label': 'DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE'}, {'phrase': 'eyes', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'neck', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'heart', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'lungs', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'abdomen', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'neurological status', 'label': 'DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE'}, {'phrase': 'complete blood count', 'label': 'DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE'}, {'phrase': 'comprehensive', 'label': 'DETAILED_DESCRIPTION'}, {'phrase': 'metabolic panel', 'label': 'DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE'}, {'phrase': 'abdominal', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'X -

"doctor: Hello, Mr. patient, I understand you're here for a follow-up visit regarding your possible idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus. Can you tell me how you've been doing since we last saw you? patient: Well, things have gotten worse. My walking and balance are much worse. I can barely walk at all now. I need a walker and help from an assistant just to stand or walk. doctor: I see. And how about your incontinence? patient: It's the same. I don't feel the need to go to the bathroom, but when I'm asked, I can tell I need to go. I wear a Depends undergarment all the time. doctor: Okay. And how is your thinking and memory? patient: They're worse too. I'm mostly apathetic. I don't talk much. I live in a skilled nursing facility in the Alzheimer's section. I do have some daytime activities and I take a nap once a day, but I don't read much anymore. doctor: I see. That's concerning. I'd like to examine you today and see if there are any changes since your last visit. doctor: (Examines the patient) Okay, Mr. patient, I've reviewed your medical history and examined you today. I'm concerned about the worsening of your gait, dementia, and incontinence. I've also noticed a new finding today, which is limited upgaze. This could be consistent with either progressive supranuclear palsy or progressive enlargement of the ventricles. patient: (Wife and daughter look at each other with concern) What does that mean? doctor: Well, it means that we need to consider all the possible causes of your symptoms and determine the best course of treatment. One option is to try a trial of CSF drainage via spinal catheter again. This is a procedure where we insert a thin tube into your spinal canal to drain excess cerebrospinal fluid. We did this over a year ago at Hospital, but it didn't seem to help at the time. However, your ventricles appear to be larger now than they were a year ago, so it's possible that hydrocephalus is still contributing to your symptoms. wife: (Hesitantly) So, you're saying that there's a chance that surgery could help? doctor: Yes, that's right. But it's important to understand that there is no guarantee. The success of shunt surgery depends on many factors, including the underlying cause of your symptoms. daughter: (With a sigh) I guess we have a lot to think about. doctor: I understand. I've given you a printed prescription of the protocol including its rationale, risks, benefits, and alternatives. Please take some time to review it with your family and contact my office if you have any questions or if you decide you would like to proceed. patient: Thank you, doctor. We appreciate your help. doctor: You're welcome. I'm here if you need me.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Follow-up visit regarding possible idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus.

Also, start her on IV fluids. nurse: Yes, doctor. doctor: (To the patient) I'm going to give you some medication to help with the nausea and vomiting. I'm also going to order some tests to try to figure out what's causing these symptoms. patient: (Nods) doctor: Okay. I'll be back to check on you soon. (Later) doctor: (To the patient) I have your test results back. It looks like you have pancreatitis, which is an inflammation of the pancreas. I'm also concerned about your diarrhea, volume depletion, hyperglycemia, hypertension, renal failure, hypokalemia, and hypercalcemia. patient: (Looks confused) doctor: I know this is a lot to take in. I'm going to explain everything to you in more detail. First, let's talk about the pancreatitis. This is a condition where the pancreas becomes inflamed. This can cause pain, nausea, and vomiting. We're going to treat this with medication and IV fluids. patient: (Nods) doctor: Next, let's talk about the diarrhea. This can be caused by a number of things, including infection, food poisoning, or a medication side effect. We're going to check your stool to see if we can find the cause. patient: (Nods) doctor: Now, let's talk about the volume depletion. This means that you don't have enough fluids in your body. This can be caused by diarrhea, vomiting, or not drinking enough fluids. We're going to give you IV fluids to help replace the fluids you've lost. patient: (Nods) doctor: Next, let's talk about the hyperglycemia. This means that you have high blood sugar. This can be caused by diabetes or other medical conditions. We're going to treat this with insulin. patient: (Nods) doctor: Now, let's talk about the hypertension. This means that you have high blood pressure. This can be caused by a number of things, including kidney disease, heart disease, or a medication side effect. We're going to prescribe medication to help lower your blood pressure. patient: (Nods) doctor: Next, let's talk about the renal failure. This means that your kidneys are not working properly. This can be caused by a number of things, including diabetes, high blood pressure, or a medication side effect. We're going to monitor your renal function and give you IV fluids to help protect your kidneys. patient: (Nods) doctor: Now, let's talk about the hypokalemia. This means that you have low potassium levels. This can be caused by a number of things, including diarrhea, vomiting, or a medication side effect. We're going to replace your potassium with IV fluids. patient: (Nods) doctor: Finally, let's talk about the hypercalcemia. This means that you have high calcium levels. This can be caused by a number of things, including kidney disease, cancer, or a medication side effect. We're going to give you IV fluids and Lasix to help lower your calcium levels. patient: (Nods) doctor: I know this is a lot to take in. I'm going to give you a written summary of your diagnosis and treatment plan. I'm also going to order a hospice evaluation for you. patient: (Nods) doctor: I'm here to answer any questions you have. Please don't hesitate to ask. patient: (Nods) doctor: Okay. I'll check on you again soon.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.

"doctor: Good morning, Mr. patient, how are you doing today? patient: I'm doing alright, Doctor. I'm here for a follow-up on my recent TIA-like event. doctor: I see. Can you tell me more about what happened? patient: Well, about three weeks ago, I was driving my car when suddenly my vision started to decrease. It was like a black sheet was coming down from the top. It lasted for about five minutes, and I felt nauseated and lightheaded during the episode. doctor: Did you experience any other symptoms, such as headaches, gait change, or focal weakness? patient: No, nothing like that. Just the vision loss. doctor: I understand. And what happened after the episode? patient: I went to the clinic that day and had a CT scan, carotid Dopplers, an echocardiogram, and a neurological evaluation. But everything came back normal. doctor: That's good to hear. The neurologist suggested a CT angiogram since I can't have an MRI due to my pacemaker. But I haven't had any further similar events since then. doctor: That's a relief. Now, let's talk about your lumbar stenosis. You mentioned that you have mild difficulty getting out of a chair. Have you experienced any back pain or pain of any type? patient: No, I don't have any pain. I'm very active, and I play tennis at least three times a week. I've also never had any bowel or bladder incontinence or frank lower extremity weakness. doctor: I see. Well, based on your symptoms, it seems like your lumbar stenosis is mild. Since you're not interested in surgical intervention at this time, we'll defer further evaluation with a CT myelogram. patient: That's good news. I'd rather not have surgery if I don't need it. doctor: Alright, let's move on to your medications. You're currently taking Plavix and Synthroid, is that correct? patient: Yes, that's right. doctor: Okay. I'm going to continue your Plavix prescription. We'll also get a CT angiogram of your cerebral vessels to evaluate the integrity of your cerebrovascular system. patient: Okay, I'll do that. doctor: Great. And finally, we'll obtain copies of the workup that was done at the outside hospital so that we don't have to repeat any unnecessary tests. patient: Sure, I'll make sure to bring those with me on my next visit. doctor: That's all for today, Mr. patient. We'll follow up on your progress at your next appointment. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms, please don't hesitate to call our office. patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Follow-up on recent TIA-like event. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a pleasant age-year-old male who presents for a follow-up on his recent TIA-like event. He reports that three weeks ago, he experienced sudden vision loss in his left eye that lasted for about five minutes. He also felt nauseated and lightheaded during the episode. He denies experiencing any headaches, gait change, or focal weakness. He underwent a CT scan, carotid Dopplers, an echocardiogram, and a neurological evaluation at an outside clinic, but all results came back normal. The neurologist suggested a CT angiogram due to the patient's pacemaker, but he has not experienced any further similar events since then. The patient also reports mild difficulty getting out of a chair but denies any back pain, bowel or bladder issues, or frank lower extremity weakness. He is currently taking Plavix and Synthyroid. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. TIA-like event Assessment: Given his history of a TIA-like event, the symptoms he experienced are concerning for a possible recurrent TIA. Although his neurological evaluation, CT scan, carotid Dopplers, and echocardiogram were normal, a CT angiogram is warranted to evaluate the integrity of his cerebrovascular system. Plan: - Obtain CT angiogram of the cerebral vessels. - Review the workup done at the outside hospital to avoid repeating unnecessary tests. - Continue Plavix. Follow-up instructions: - Follow up in clinic in 1 week. 2. Lumbar stenosis Assessment: Patient has mild difficulty getting out of a chair. However, he is very active and plays tennis at least three times a week. He also has never had any bowel or bladder incontinence or frank lower extremity weakness, suggesting mild lumbar stenosis. Plan: - Patient is not interested in surgical intervention at this time. Therefore, we will defer further evaluation with a CT myelogram.

"doctor: Good morning, Mr./Ms. patient. How are you doing today? patient: I'm not doing so well, doctor. I've been having some abdominal pain. doctor: I see. Can you tell me more about the pain? Where is it located? patient: It's mostly in my lower abdomen, but it sometimes radiates to my back. doctor: How long have you been having the pain? patient: For about a week now. doctor: Have you noticed anything else unusual, such as changes in your bowel movements or urination? patient: Yes, I've been having more frequent urination and it burns when I go. doctor: I see. Well, I'm going to examine you now to try to figure out what's causing your pain. doctor: (Examines the patient's abdomen) Your abdomen is soft and nontender. There is no organomegaly or CVA tenderness. No hernias are noted. doctor: (Checks the patient's vital signs) Your blood pressure is 120/80 mmHg, your pulse is 80 bpm, and your respirations are 12 pm. You are afebrile. doctor: Based on your symptoms and examination, I think you have a urinary tract infection (UTI). patient: A UTI? What is that? doctor: A UTI is an infection of the urinary tract, which includes the bladder, urethra, and kidneys. It is usually caused by bacteria that enter the urethra and travel up into the bladder. patient: How do I get a UTI? doctor: UTIs are more common in women than in men, but they can occur in anyone. There are a number of things that can increase your risk of getting a UTI, such as having diabetes, being sexually active, or using a catheter. patient: I have diabetes. Could that be why I got a UTI? doctor: Yes, diabetes can increase your risk of getting a UTI. That's because high blood sugar levels can damage the nerves that control the bladder, making it more difficult to empty the bladder completely. This can lead to bacteria building up in the bladder and causing an infection. doctor: I'm going to prescribe you some antibiotics to treat the UTI. I also want you to see an endocrinologist to help you manage your diabetes. patient: Okay, I will. Thank you, doctor. doctor: You're welcome. I hope you feel better soon.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Abdominal pain.

I understand you're here for a diagnostic lumbar puncture to rule out possible malignancy. patient: Yes, that's right. doctor: I see you're accompanied by your daughter. daughter: Yes, I'm here to support my mother. doctor: That's great. I'll be asking you some questions to better understand your condition, and I encourage you both to ask any questions you may have. patient: Sure. doctor: Can you tell me more about the symptoms you've been experiencing? daughter: Over the past month, my mother has gradually stopped walking, even with her walker. Her left arm has also become less functional, making it difficult for her to use the walker. She hasn't had any headaches, but she has experienced a significant decrease in appetite. doctor: I see. Do you know what type of lung cancer you have, Ms. Wilson? patient: No, I don't. doctor: According to your follow-up notes, it's presumed to be non-small cell lung cancer of the left upper lobe. The last note I have to evaluate is from October 2008. doctor: I've also reviewed your recent CT scan, MRI, and blood tests. The CT scan shows atrophy and small vessel ischemic change, but no mass lesion. The MRI does not suggest normal pressure hydrocephalus or show any mass lesion. Your blood tests from November 2009 indicate a platelet count of 132 and an INR of 1.0. patient: Okay. doctor: Based on your symptoms and the results of your tests, we're concerned about the possibility of CSF malignancy. We'll need to perform a lumbar puncture to collect a sample of your cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for further analysis. daughter: What does that involve? doctor: It's a procedure where we insert a needle into your lower back to extract a small amount of CSF. It's usually done with local anesthesia, so you'll be awake during the procedure, but you shouldn't feel any pain. patient: I'm a little nervous. doctor: That's understandable. We'll take all necessary precautions to ensure your comfort and safety. daughter: Thank you, doctor. doctor: You're welcome. Before we proceed, I'll need your written consent and your daughter's signature as a witness. patient: Sure. doctor: Once we have your consent, I'll explain the procedure in more detail and answer any remaining questions you may have. patient: Okay. doctor: Great. I'll be back shortly with the consent forms. After obtaining consent, the doctor prepares the patient for the lumbar puncture. doctor: Okay, Ms. Wilson, we're all set. I'm going to clean the area on your lower back and inject some local anesthetic to numb the area. You may feel a slight pinch. patient: Okay. doctor: Once the area is numb, I'll insert the needle into your lower back. You may feel some pressure or discomfort, but it shouldn't be painful. patient: Alright. doctor: I'm going to collect about 15 cc of CSF. This will take a few minutes. After collecting the CSF, the doctor applies a bandage to the puncture site. doctor: Okay, we're done. You did great, Ms. Wilson. The CSF sample will be sent to the lab for analysis, and we'll discuss the results at your follow-up appointment. patient: Thank you, doctor. doctor: You're welcome. I'll see you then.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Diagnostic lumbar puncture to rule out possible malignancy.

"doctor: Hello patient, thank you for coming in today. What seems to be the problem? patient: I've been having abdominal pain and discomfort for the past three weeks. It started out as a diffuse pain in my epigastrium and right upper quadrant, and it's been getting worse. I also have indigestion and right scapular pain. doctor: How severe is the pain? patient: It's pretty bad. It's hard to do my normal activities. doctor: Does anything make the pain better or worse? patient: No, nothing seems to help. doctor: Have you seen a doctor about this before? patient: Yes, I went to an outside hospital and they did an ultrasound, CT, and MRI. They found a 12.5 X 10.9 X 11.1 cm right suprarenal mass and a 7.1 X 5.4 X 6.5 cm intrahepatic mass in the region of the dome of the liver. They also found multiple small (<5 mm) bilateral lung nodules. doctor: That's concerning. I'm going to need to do a physical exam and order some more tests. doctor: (after the physical exam) I'm going to admit you to the hospital so we can run some more tests and figure out what's causing your pain. patient: Okay. doctor: I'm also going to consult with a surgeon to see if we need to do surgery. patient: Surgery? doctor: It's possible. We need to find out more about these masses before we can make a decision. patient: I'm scared. doctor: I understand. We're going to do everything we can to help you. patient: Thank you. doctor: You're welcome. We'll keep you updated on your condition.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Abdominal pain and discomfort. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a pleasant age-year-old male who presents to the clinic for evaluation of abdominal pain and discomfort. The patient reports that the pain started out as a diffuse pain in his epigastrium and right upper quadrant approximately three weeks ago and has been progressively worsening. The patient also reports indigestion and right scapular pain. The patient states that the pain is severe and interferes with his normal activities. The patient denies any specific factors that make the pain better or worse. The patient reports that he was seen at an outside hospital approximately one week ago where he underwent an ultrasound, CT, and MRI. The results of the imaging studies revealed a 12.5 X 10.9 X 11.1 cm right suprarenal mass and a 7.1 X 5.4 X 6.5 cm intrahepatic mass in the region of the dome of the liver. The patient also reports that multiple small (<5 mm) bilateral lung nodules were noted. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. Abdominal pain and discomfort, likely due to right suprarenal mass and intrahepatic mass Assessment: The patient has a 12.5 X 10.9 X 11.1 cm right suprarenal mass and a 7.1 X 5.4 X 6.5 cm intrahepatic mass. These masses are likely causing the patient's abdominal pain and discomfort. Differential diagnosis includes malignancy (such as adrenal carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma) and benign tumors. Plan: - Admit the patient to the hospital for further evaluation and management. - Order additional blood tests, including liver function tests, adrenal function tests, and tumor markers. - Order a biopsy of the right suprarenal mass and intrahepatic mass to confirm the diagnosis. - Consult with a surgeon to discuss the possibility of surgery. 2. Multiple small bilateral lung nodules Assessment: The patient has multiple small (<5 mm) bilateral lung nodules. These nodules may be benign or malignant. Plan: - Order a chest CT scan to further evaluate the lung nodules. - If the lung nodules are suspicious for malignancy, will order a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. Follow-up instructions: - The patient will be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and management. - The patient will be updated on the results of the tests and biopsy as soon as they are available.","[{'phrase': 'abdominal', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'pain', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'discomfort', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'past', 'label': 'DURATION'}, {'phrase': 'three weeks', 'label': 'DURATION'}, {'phrase': 'diffuse', 'label': 'DETAILED_DESCRIPTION'}, {'phrase': 'pain', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'epi gas trium', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'right upper quadrant', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'indigestion', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'right scapular', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'pain', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'pain', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'pain', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'outside hospital', 'label': 'NONBIOLOGICAL_LOCATION'}, {'phrase': 'ultrasound', 'label': 'DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE'}, {'phrase': 'CT', 'label': 'DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE'}, {'phrase': 'MRI', 'label': 'DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE'}, {'phrase': '12', 'label': 'DISTANCE'}, {'phrase': '. 5 X', 'label': 'AREA'}, {'phrase': '10 . 9 X 11 . 1 cm', 'label': 'VOLUME'}, {'phrase': 'right supra renal', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'mass', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': '7', 'label': 'VOLUME'}, {'phrase': '. 1 X 5 . 4 X 6 . 5 cm', 'label': 'AREA'}, {'phrase': 'intra hepatic', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'mass', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'region of the dome of the liver', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'multiple', 'label': 'DETAILED_DESCRIPTION'}, {'phrase': 'small', 'label': 'DETAILED_DESCRIPTION'}, {'phrase': '< 5 mm', 'label': 'DISTANCE'}, {'phrase': 'bilateral', 'label': 'DETAILED_DESCRIPTION'}, {'phrase': 'lung', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'nodules', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'physical exam', 'label': 'DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE'}, {'phrase': 'admit', 'label': 'CLINICAL_EVENT'}, {'phrase': 'hospital', 'label': 'NONBIOLOGICAL_LOCATION'}, {'phrase': 'pain', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}]","[{'phrase': 'abdominal', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'pain', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'discomfort', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'past', 'label': 'DURATION'}, {'phrase': 'three weeks', 'label': 'DURATION'}, {'phrase': 'diffuse', 'label': 'DETAILED_DESCRIPTION'}, {'phrase': 'epi gas trium', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'right upper quadrant', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'indigestion', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'right scapular', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'outside hospital', 'label': 'NONBIOLOGICAL_LOCATION'}, {'phrase': 'ultrasound', 'label': 'DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE'}, {'phrase': 'CT', 'label': 'DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE'}, {'phrase': 'MRI', 'label': 'DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE'}, {'phrase': '12', 'label': 'DISTANCE'}, {'phrase': '. 5 X', 'label': 'AREA'}, {'phrase': '10 . 9 X 11 . 1 cm', 'label': 'VOLUME'}, {'phrase': 'right supra renal', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'mass', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': '7', 'label': 'VOLUME'}, {'phrase': '. 1 X 5 . 4 X 6 . 5 cm', 'label': 'AREA'}, {'phrase': 'intra hepatic', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'region of the dome of the liver', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'multiple', 'label': 'DETAILED_DESCRIPTION'}, {'phrase': 'small', 'label': 'DETAILED_DESCRIPTION'}, {'phrase': '< 5 mm', 'label': 'DISTANCE'}, {'phrase': 'bilateral', 'label': 'DETAILED_DESCRIPTION'}, {'phrase': 'lung', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'nodules', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'physical exam', 'label': 'DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE'}, {'phrase': 'admit', 'label': 'CLINICAL_EVENT'}, {'phrase': 'hospital', 'label': 'NONBIOLOGICAL_LOCATION'}]","['abdominal', 'pain', 'discomfort', 'past', 'three weeks', 'diffuse', 'pain', 'epi gas trium', 'right upper quadrant', 'indigestion', 'right scapular', 'pain', 'pain', 'pain', 'outside hospital', 'ultrasound', 'CT', 'MRI', '12', '. 5 X', '10 . 9 X 11 . 1 cm', 'right supra renal', 'mass', '7', '. 1 X 5 . 4 X 6 . 5 cm', 'intra hepatic', 'mass', 'region of the dome of the liver', 'multiple', 'small', '< 5 mm', 'bilateral', 'lung', 'nodules', 'physical exam', 'admit', 'hospital', 'pain']","['abdominal', 'pain', 'discomfort', 'past', 'three weeks', 'diffuse', 'epi gas trium', 'right upper quadrant', 'indigestion', 'right scapular', 'outside hospital', 'ultrasound', 'CT', 'MRI', '12', '. 5 X', '10 . 9 X 11 . 1 cm', 'right supra renal', 'mass', '7', '. 1 X 5 . 4 X 6 . 5 cm', 'intra hepatic', 'region of the dome of the liver', 'multiple', 'small', '< 5 mm', 'bilateral', 'lung', 'nodules', 'physical exam', 'admit', 'hospital']"

Well, I'm going to prescribe you a stronger medication to help clear up the rash. It's called Solu-Medrol, and it's a steroid injection. patient: Okay. doctor: I'm also going to recommend that you continue taking over-the-counter Benadryl or the prescription allergy medicine that you were given last time you were here. That should help to relieve the itching and discomfort. patient: Alright. doctor: I'm also going to give you some instructions on how to care for the rash at home. Make sure to keep the area clean and dry, and avoid scratching or picking at it. You can also apply cool compresses to the rash to help relieve the itching. patient: Thank you. doctor: You're welcome.

I'm going to examine you now. doctor: Your reflexes are all normal, and your sensation is intact. Your gait and stance are also normal. patient: That's good to hear. doctor: I'm going to schedule you for an EMG and nerve conduction studies to see if there's any evidence of nerve damage, although I think the likelihood is low.

"Doctor: Hello, patient, I understand you're here today because of some allergy problems? Patient: Yes, that's right. I used to have allergies when I lived in Seattle, but they seem to be worse here. Doctor: I see. Can you tell me more about your symptoms? Patient: Well, I have a lot of sneezing, a runny nose, and itchy, watery eyes. My nose is also stuffy and I have a sore throat. Doctor: How long have you been experiencing these symptoms? Patient: For about two weeks now. Doctor: Have you tried any medications to relieve your symptoms? Patient: Yes, I've tried Claritin, Zyrtec, and Allegra. They all worked for a short time, but then they seemed to stop working. Doctor: I see. Have you tried any over-the-counter nasal sprays? Patient: No, I haven't. Doctor: Okay. Well, I think you have allergic rhinitis. This is a common condition that causes inflammation of the nasal passages. It's usually caused by an allergy to something in the environment, such as pollen, dust, or pet dander. Patient: I see. So, what can I do to treat it? Doctor: There are a few things you can do. First, you can try taking Zyrtec again. It's a different type of antihistamine than Claritin and Allegra, so it might work better for you. You can also try using loratadine. It's a non-prescription antihistamine that's also effective for treating allergic rhinitis. Patient: Okay, I'll try that. Doctor: I'm also going to give you some samples of Nasonex nasal spray. This is a prescription nasal spray that can help to reduce inflammation and congestion. You should use it twice a day for three weeks. Patient: Okay, thank you. Doctor: You're welcome.

"doctor: Hello, Mrs. patient, it's nice to see you again. patient: Thank you, Doctor. doctor: I understand you're here for a follow-up appointment for your chronic atrial fibrillation. How have you been feeling since I last saw you? patient: Well, I've been having some shortness of breath and wheezing at night. I think it's because of my heart failure. I also get short of breath when I try to walk a city block. doctor: I see. And are you still taking your medications as prescribed? patient: I think so, but I'm not sure if I'm taking them correctly. I didn't bring them with me today. doctor: That's okay. I can check your records. It looks like you're taking Fosamax, lisinopril, metformin, amlodipine, metoprolol, warfarin, potassium, and magnesium oxide. patient: Yes, that sounds right. doctor: I'm going to order an ECG and an echocardiogram today to get a better look at your heart. patient: Okay. doctor: The ECG shows that you're still in atrial fibrillation, and your heart rate is a little faster than it was at your last visit. The echocardiogram shows that your ejection fraction is 50%, and you have paradoxical septal motion. Your right ventricular systolic pressure is normal, and there are no significant valvular abnormalities. patient: What does that mean? doctor: It means that your heart muscle is working well, but the ventricles are not filling properly. This can cause shortness of breath and fatigue. patient: I see. doctor: I'm going to restart your Lasix at 80 mg daily to help reduce the fluid retention. I'd like you to come back to the heart failure clinic in about 10 days so we can check your heart rate again. If it's still elevated, we may need to switch your amlodipine to diltiazem. If that doesn't work, you may need to have a pacemaker and your AV node ablated. patient: Okay. I'll do that. doctor: I'm also going to ask you to start taking potassium and magnesium supplements. These can help to improve your heart function. patient: I will. doctor: I know this is a lot to take in, but I'm here to help you. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask. patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Follow-up appointment for chronic atrial fibrillation. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a pleasant age-year-old female who presents for a follow-up appointment for her chronic atrial fibrillation. She reports shortness of breath and wheezing at night, which she attributes to her heart failure. She also experiences shortness of breath upon walking a city block. The patient is unsure if she is taking her medications correctly, as she did not bring them with her to the appointment. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. Chronic atrial fibrillation Assessment: ECG shows atrial fibrillation, and echocardiogram shows paradoxical septal motion. Ejection fraction is 50%, right ventricular systolic pressure is normal, and there are no significant valvular abnormalities. Plan: - Restart Lasix 80mg daily. - Will order repeat ECG and echo in 10 days. - If heart rate still elevated, switch amlodipine to diltiazem. - If that doesn't work, may need pacemaker and AV node ablation. - Start potassium and magnesium supplements. 2. Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction Assessment: Symptoms of shortness of breath and fatigue. Echocardiogram shows paradoxical septal motion and normal right ventricular systolic pressure. Plan: - Restart Lasix 80mg daily. - Will order repeat ECG and echo in 10 days. - If heart rate still elevated, switch amlodipine to diltiazem. - If that doesn't work, may need pacemaker and AV node ablation. - Start potassium and magnesium supplements. 3.

I woke up this morning and my right arm was weak and I was having trouble speaking. doctor: I see. Can you tell me a little bit more about your symptoms? patient: Well, my right arm is definitely weak. I can't lift it up very high and I have trouble gripping things. I'm also having trouble speaking. I can understand what people are saying, but I have trouble getting the words out. doctor: Okay. Have you had any other symptoms, like headache, visual changes, chest pain, or shortness of breath? patient: No, nothing like that. doctor: And have your symptoms been getting better or worse since they started? patient: They've stayed about the same. doctor: I see. Do you have any idea what might have caused this? patient: I'm not sure. I've been feeling fine until this morning. doctor: Okay. Well, I'm going to do a few tests to try to figure out what's going on. I'm going to order a head CT and an MRI to look at your brain. I'm also going to order some blood tests and an ultrasound of your carotids. patient: Okay. doctor: I'm also going to start you on some medications to help with your symptoms. I'm going to give you an antibiotic to treat your urinary tract infection, and I'm going to give you some antiplatelet therapy to help prevent blood clots. I'm also going to give you some fluids to help with your dehydration. patient: Thank you. doctor: You're welcome. I'm going to have a nurse come in and start your IV. I'll be back to check on you later. patient: Okay. daughter: Doctor, I have a few questions. doctor: Sure, what are they? daughter: What do you think caused my mother's symptoms? doctor: I'm not sure yet. We need to wait for the test results to come back. But based on her symptoms, I'm concerned that she may have had a stroke or a transient ischemic attack (TIA). daughter: What's the difference between a stroke and a TIA? doctor: A stroke is a sudden loss of blood flow to the brain. A TIA is a temporary loss of blood flow to the brain. The symptoms of a TIA are usually the same as the symptoms of a stroke, but they go away within 24 hours. daughter: I see. So, what are the chances that my mother had a stroke? doctor: It's hard to say for sure until we get the test results back. But based on her symptoms, I would say that the chances are fairly high. daughter: What are the chances that she'll have another stroke? doctor: That also depends on the test results.

"doctor: Hello Mr./Ms. patient, thank you for coming in today. I understand you're here for management of hepatic encephalopathy? patient: Yes, that's right. doctor: Can you tell me a little bit about what's been going on? patient: Well, I was doing fine until I fell in the bathroom last night. I was just sitting watching TV and I felt sleepy, so I went to the bathroom to urinate before going to bed. While I was trying to lift the seat, I tripped and fell and hit my head on the toilet seat. It started bleeding and I had pain in the area with a headache. I didn't lose consciousness, though. I went and woke up my sister, and she brought a towel to cover the laceration on the back of my head and called EMS. They came to my house and brought me to the emergency room. doctor: I see. And what happened after you got to the emergency room? patient: They found that I had a laceration on the back of my head, which they stapled. They also did a CT of my head and ruled out any acute intracranial pathology. But my ammonia levels were found to be markedly elevated at 106, so I'm being admitted for management of that. doctor: Okay, I understand. Have you been having any other symptoms besides the fall and the head injury? patient: No, I haven't had any abdominal pain, change in bowel habits, GI bleed, hematemesis, melena, or hematochezia. I've been taking my medications, but I can't remember what they are. I also don't remember having any symptoms prior to the fall. doctor: I see. Well, I'm going to examine you now and then we can discuss your treatment plan. The doctor performs a physical examination. doctor: Your examination is essentially unremarkable except for a laceration on the back of your head with two staples, which is still oozing minimally and is tender. You also have +1 edema bilaterally and several spider angiomas noted on your torso and upper extremities consistent with liver cirrhosis. Your right-sided spastic hemiparesis with increased tone, increased reflexes, and weakness is consistent with your history of subdural hematoma. patient: Okay. doctor: So, based on your history and examination, I'm going to admit you to the hospital for management of your hepatic encephalopathy. We'll start you on lactulose and monitor your ammonia levels closely. We'll also need to address your other medical conditions, such as your liver cirrhosis and diabetes. patient: Okay, I understand. doctor: I'll also order a few tests to get a better understanding of your condition, such as a liver function panel, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. patient: Sure. doctor: I'll be back later to check on you and answer any questions you may have. patient: Thank you, doctor.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Management of hepatic encephalopathy.

"patient: Doctor, I've been having some problems with my left leg swelling. It's been going on for about three years now, but it's gotten worse in the past few months. It's usually better in the morning when I'm up and moving around, but it starts to swell again as the day goes on. Lately, it's been staying swollen and it's starting to make me uncomfortable. doctor: I see. And have you noticed any swelling in your right leg as well? patient: Yes, my right leg swells too, but not as much as my left leg. doctor: Okay. What about any pain in your joints? patient: Yes, I've been having pain in my left shoulder and back. The shoulder pain started about a year ago, and it's gotten worse over time. It's hard to get my hand behind my back or behind my head, and I've lost some strength in my left shoulder. The back pain is more of a dull ache, and I think it's probably from my mattress. doctor: I see. And have you had any blood work done recently? patient: Yes, I had some blood work done in April, and my white blood cell count was elevated. Dr. XYZ referred me to Dr. XYZ, but he didn't seem too concerned about it and told me to just come back here for follow-up. doctor: Okay. I'll take a look at your blood work results. Anything else you've been experiencing? patient: I've also been having increased frequency of urination, especially at night. I have to get up two or three times to use the bathroom. And I've gained some weight recently, about 12 pounds since March. My blood pressure has been stable, though. doctor: I see. And what about your breathing? Have you noticed any shortness of breath? patient: Yes, I've been feeling more short of breath lately. I work as a bus dispatcher for the city of Wichita, and I sit a lot during the day. I don't really move around much, and by the end of the day, my leg is really swollen. doctor: Okay. Well, let's take a look at your leg and do a physical exam. doctor: (Examines the patient's leg) Your left leg is definitely swollen. There's at least 2+ pedal edema. Your right leg has just a trace of edema. I'm also going to order a venous Doppler of your left leg and a CBC and metabolic panel. I'm going to start you on Detrol 0.4 mg once daily and Mobic 15 mg per day. patient: Okay. What else can I do to help with the swelling? doctor: Elevate your leg as much as possible and wear support hose if you can. Keep your foot up during the day. We'll see you back in two weeks to review the results of the Doppler and lab work and see how you're doing with the Detrol and the joint pain. If your shoulder pain is not any better, we'll probably refer you to an orthopedist. We did do x-rays of your shoulder today, and they didn't show anything remarkable.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Left leg swelling. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a pleasant age-year-old male who presents for evaluation of left leg swelling. He reports left leg swelling for 3 years, worse in the past few months. The swelling is better in the morning and worse at the end of the day. He also reports right leg swelling, but to a lesser extent. He denies recent changes in hearing, new hemorrhoids, or problems with concha bullosa of the left nostril or septal deviation. He also reports pain in his left shoulder and back. The shoulder pain started about a year ago and has worsened over time. It is difficult for him to get his hand behind his back or behind his head, and he has lost some strength in his left shoulder. The back pain is more of a dull ache, and he thinks it is probably from his mattress. He also reports increased frequency of urination, especially at night. He has to get up two or three times to use the bathroom. He has gained 12 pounds since March. He denies shortness of breath. He works as a bus dispatcher and sits a lot during the day. He does not move around much, and by the end of the day, his leg is really swollen. Blood work done in April showed an elevated white blood cell count. He was referred to Dr. XYZ, but he was not concerned and told the patient to come back here for follow-up. Physical exam revealed 2+ pedal edema in the left leg and trace edema in the right leg. X-rays of the shoulder were unremarkable. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. Left leg swelling Assessment: Patient has 2+ pedal edema on the left leg and trace edema on the right leg. Patient also reports increased frequency of urination, especially at night. Venous Doppler was ordered to rule out deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Plan: - Start Detrol 0.4 mg once daily. - Will review the results of the Doppler in 2 weeks. 2. Shoulder pain Assessment: Patient reports pain in the left shoulder for about a year, with associated weakness. Examination showed limitation of range of motion. X-rays of the shoulder were negative. Plan: - Start Mobic 15 mg per day. - Will review the response to Mobic in 2 weeks. If not improved, will refer to orthopedics. 3.

"doctor: Welcome back to the Pulmonary Medicine Clinic, Mrs. Smith. I understand you're here for a follow-up evaluation of your interstitial disease secondary to lupus pneumonitis. patient: That's right, Doctor. doctor: How have you been doing since your last visit in January 2004? patient: My respiratory status has been pretty good overall. I haven't had any major respiratory difficulties. But starting yesterday, I've had increasing back and joint pain. Taking a deep breath causes some discomfort in my back. doctor: I see. And have you had any problems with coughing or producing sputum? patient: No, I haven't had any problems with that. I also haven't had any fevers or chills. doctor: Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your fatigue levels recently? patient: Yes, I've been feeling a bit more fatigued lately. doctor: That's something we'll need to look into. Aside from the back pain and fatigue, have you had any other pulmonary limitations to your activity? patient: No, for the most part, I've been able to do my usual activities without any problems. doctor: That's good to hear. Now, let's talk about your current medications. You mentioned that you were taking Synthroid, Prilosec, prednisone, Plaquenil, Imuran, Advair, Premarin, Lipitor, Actonel, and aspirin. Is that correct? patient: Yes, that's right. doctor: I see that you stopped taking prednisone on June 16th. Why was that? patient: My doctor told me I could stop taking it since my lupus has been under control. doctor: Okay. We'll need to keep an eye on that. You also mentioned that you're allergic to penicillin and shellfish. Is there anything else I should know about your allergies? patient: No, that's all. doctor: Alright. Let's move on to the physical exam. Your vital signs are all within normal limits. Your nasal mucosa is mildly erythematous and edematous, but your oropharynx is clear. Your neck is supple without any palpable lymphadenopathy. Your chest demonstrates decreased breath sounds, but it's clear. Your cardiovascular system is regular in rate and rhythm. Your abdomen is soft and nontender. Your extremities are without edema and there are no skin lesions. Your oxygen saturation was checked at rest and it was 96%. On ambulation, it varied between 94% and 96%. doctor: I've also reviewed your chest x-ray from today. It shows mild increased interstitial markings consistent with a history of lupus pneumonitis. Unfortunately, we don't have a previous chest x-ray to compare it to. However, when I compared the markings to your previous CT scan, they appear to be less prominent. patient: That's good news. doctor: It is. Now, let's talk about the next steps. Based on your current symptoms and the results of your physical exam and chest x-ray, I'm going to recommend that we continue with your current medications. I'd like to see you back in about four to five months for a follow-up visit. At that time, we'll recheck your pulmonary function test and do another chest CT scan. If your pulmonary status is stable and your lupus is under control, we may consider weaning you off of Imuran. patient: Okay. I'll make sure to come back for my follow-up visit. doctor: Great. In the meantime, if you have any new symptoms or if your condition worsens, please don't hesitate to call our office. patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Follow-up evaluation of interstitial disease secondary to lupus pneumonitis.

"doctor: Hello, Mr. patient, I'm Dr. doctor. I understand you're here today because you're concerned about your cholesterol levels. patient: Yes, that's right. I got a letter from my doctor saying that my cholesterol is elevated. I'm a little worried about it. doctor: I can understand your concern. High cholesterol can increase your risk for heart disease and stroke. But the good news is that there are things you can do to lower your cholesterol levels. patient: That's good to hear. What can I do? doctor: Well, let's start by talking about your diet. Can you tell me what you typically eat in a day? patient: Sure. I usually start my day with a cappuccino and a croissant. For lunch, I often eat out, and I usually get something like a quiche or a sandwich. And for dinner, I usually have meat with potatoes and vegetables. I also snack on candy from the vending machines at work. doctor: I see. Well, there are a few things you can change in your diet to help lower your cholesterol. First, you should try to limit your intake of saturated and trans fats. These fats are found in foods like red meat, processed meats, and fried foods. You should also try to eat more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. These foods are high in fiber, which can help lower cholesterol levels. patient: Okay, I can do that. What else can I do? doctor: Another thing you can do is to exercise regularly. Exercise can help to lower cholesterol levels and improve your overall heart health. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week. patient: I'm already exercising six to seven days a week. I swim, bike, run, and lift weights. doctor: That's great! Keep up the good work. patient: I'm also trying to lose weight. I've already lost a few pounds by eating healthier and exercising more. doctor: That's excellent progress. Keep up the good work! I'd like to see you again in a few months to check your cholesterol levels again and see how you're doing. patient: Okay, I will. Thank you for your help, Dr. doctor. doctor: You're welcome.

"doctor: Good morning, Mr. patient, I understand you're here today for left knee pain. Can you tell me more about what's been going on? patient: Sure, doctor. About two weeks ago, I fell in a grocery store. I slipped on a grape that was on the floor. I went to the emergency room and then followed up with my primary care physician. He referred me to physical therapy. doctor: I see. And how has the pain been since then? patient: It's been pretty bad, especially when I walk. I'd say it's about a 6 out of 10 on the pain scale. But it doesn't hurt at night. doctor: That's good to hear. I'm also noticing that you're wearing a knee brace. Can you tell me more about that? patient: Yeah, I got this brace after I saw my doctor. It helps to support my knee and reduce the pain. doctor: Okay, I'd like to take a closer look at your knee. Can you please lie down on the exam table? patient: Sure. doctor: (Examines the patient's knee) I'm seeing some swelling and tenderness around your knee joint. I'm also noticing that you have limited range of motion. Can you try bending and straightening your knee for me? patient: (Attempts to bend and straighten knee) It hurts when I do that. doctor: Okay, that's understandable. I'm also going to test your strength. Can you try pushing against my hand with your knee? patient: (Attempts to push against doctor's hand) It's weak. doctor: Okay, I've got a good understanding of your condition. I think you have a synovitis and anterior cruciate ligament tear of your left knee. This is likely due to the fall you had. patient: What does that mean? doctor: It means that the lining of your knee joint is inflamed and the ligament that helps to stabilize your knee is torn. This can cause pain, swelling, and difficulty moving your knee. patient: That sounds serious. What can I do about it? doctor: I'm going to recommend that you start physical therapy.

"Patient: Hello, doctor. I'm here because I've been having pain in my right shoulder for about a week now. Doctor: I see. Can you tell me more about the pain? When did it start, and what were you doing when it started? Patient: It started on June 30th. I was lifting stacks of cardboard at work. I would pick up a stack at waist level, twist to the right, and deliver it at about waist level. Sometimes I had to throw the stacks a little bit. I felt a popping sensation that day. Doctor: Okay. And since then, have you had any pain in your shoulder? Patient: Yes, I've had persistent pain with lifting activities. Doctor: Where exactly do you feel the pain? Patient: It's mostly in the posterior and lateral aspect of my shoulder. Doctor: Have you noticed any other symptoms, like numbness or tingling in your arm or hand? Patient: No, I haven't had any of those symptoms. Doctor: I see. I'm going to examine your shoulder now. (The doctor performs a physical examination.) Doctor: Your blood pressure is 120/90, your respirations are 10, your pulse is 72, and your temperature is 97.2. Your skin is warm and dry. Your neurologic examination is normal. Your ENT examination reveals normal oropharynx, nasopharynx, and tympanic membranes. Your neck has full range of motion with no adenopathy or thyromegaly. Your cardiovascular system has a regular rate and rhythm. Your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft. Doctor: Based on your symptoms and the examination, I think you have a right shoulder impingement. This is a condition where the tendons in your shoulder become inflamed and irritated. It's often caused by repetitive overhead activities, like lifting or throwing. Patient: I see. What can I do to treat it? Doctor: There are a few things we can do. First, I'm going to prescribe some physical therapy to help strengthen the muscles around your shoulder and improve your range of motion. I'm also going to give you some anti-inflammatory medication to help reduce the pain and swelling. Patient: Okay. Thank you, doctor. Doctor: You're welcome.

"doctor: Hello, Mr. patient, I understand you're here today because you experienced a brief episode of visual loss three weeks ago. Can you tell me more about what happened? patient: Sure, doctor. I was driving my car when my vision started to decrease. It felt like a black sheet was coming down from the top, compressing my vision. The episode lasted about five minutes, and I was able to pull over to the side of the road safely. I felt nauseated and lightheaded during the episode, and my wife said I looked very pale and ashen. doctor: That sounds concerning. Did you seek medical attention at the time? patient: Yes, I went to the clinic and had a CT scan, carotid Dopplers, an echocardiogram, and a neurological evaluation. Everything came back normal. The doctor suggested I get a CT angiogram since I can't have an MRI due to my pacemaker. doctor: I see. Have you had any similar episodes since then? patient: No, I haven't. My vision has been fine since that one episode. doctor: That's good to hear. Now, let's talk about your lumbar stenosis. You mentioned that you've been diagnosed with it, but you don't have any significant pain or other symptoms. Is that correct? patient: That's right. I've had some mild difficulty getting out of a chair, but other than that, I'm very active. I play tennis three times a week and don't have any back pain or weakness. doctor: I understand. So, you're not interested in surgical intervention at this time? patient: No, I'm not. I'm managing well with my current level of activity. doctor: Okay, we can defer further evaluation with a CT myelogram for now. We'll continue to monitor your lumbar stenosis and see how you do. patient: Thank you, doctor. doctor: You're welcome. Now, let's discuss your medications. You're currently taking Plavix, Proscar, and Synthroid, is that correct? patient: Yes, that's right. doctor: We'll continue the Plavix and Synthroid. We'll also obtain copies of the workup done at the outside hospital so we can review your previous test results. patient: Okay, I'll do that. doctor: And finally, let's schedule a CT angiogram to evaluate the integrity of your cerebrovascular system. This will help us determine the cause of your transient visual loss. patient: Sure, I can do that. doctor: Great. We'll get that scheduled for you as soon as possible. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms, please don't hesitate to call our office. patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Transient visual loss.

"doctor: Good morning, Mr. Smith. How are you feeling today? patient: (nonverbal, confused look on face) doctor: I understand you've been experiencing some abdominal pain. Can you tell me a little bit more about it? patient: (unable to provide further history) doctor (to the patient's son): Can you tell me anything about your father's symptoms? son: He started having severe pain in his abdomen yesterday. He was also very confused and disoriented. We took him to the emergency room, where they did a CT scan. The scan showed that he has a dilated bladder with a thick wall, suggesting an outlet obstruction, as well as bilateral hydronephrosis and hydroureter. doctor: Thank you for that information. I'm going to examine your father now. (Doctor performs physical examination) doctor: Your father is currently afebrile. His pulse is 52, respirations are 20, blood pressure is 104/41, and he is saturating 98% on room air. He is awake but not oriented x3 and is in no acute distress. His pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. Extraocular movements are intact. Mucous membranes are dry. Neck is supple with no thyromegaly or jugular venous distention. Heart is irregularly irregular and bradycardic. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally anteriorly. Abdomen has positive normoactive bowel sounds, is soft, and has tenderness in the suprapubic region without rebound. There is no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema in the upper or lower extremities. doctor: Based on your father's symptoms and the results of his CT scan, I believe he has sepsis. I'm going to start him on IV antibiotics and fluids. I'm also going to order some additional tests to help us determine the cause of the infection. son: What are the chances of my father recovering? doctor: The prognosis for sepsis depends on a number of factors, including the severity of the infection, the patient's age and overall health, and the timeliness of treatment. Your father is elderly and has a number of underlying health conditions, which makes him more vulnerable to complications. However, we're going to do everything we can to help him fight this infection. son: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help. doctor: You're welcome. I'll keep you updated on your father's progress.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Abdominal pain. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a non-verbal elderly male who presents with severe abdominal pain, confusion, and disorientation that started yesterday. His son reports that the patient was taken to the emergency room, where a CT scan revealed a dilated bladder with a thick wall, suggesting an outlet obstruction, as well as bilateral hydronephrosis and hydroureter. The patient is afebrile, has a pulse of 52, respirations of 20, blood pressure of 104/41, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. He is awake but not oriented x3 and is in no acute distress.

So, the plan today is to perform another injection of Deflux. patient: Okay. doctor: Before we proceed, I need to explain the procedure to you and obtain your consent. The cystoscopy will involve inserting a small camera into your bladder through your urethra. This will allow me to see the inside of your bladder and ureters. I will then inject Deflux into the ureteral orifices to help prevent reflux. patient: I understand. doctor: Are you allergic to any medications? patient: No, I'm not allergic to any medications. doctor: Do you have any questions about the procedure? patient: No, I don't have any questions. doctor: Okay. I'm going to start by giving you some antibiotics through your IV. Once you're asleep, I'll insert the cystoscope and inject the Deflux. The procedure should take about 30 minutes. patient: Okay. doctor: I'll be back in a few minutes to start the procedure. After the procedure doctor: The procedure went well. I was able to inject Deflux into both of your ureteral orifices. I also used the HIT technique to help prevent reflux. patient: That's good to hear. doctor: You may experience some mild discomfort or burning during urination for the next few days. This is normal and should go away on its own. I'm going to prescribe you some pain medication to help with the discomfort. patient: Thank you. doctor: You're welcome.

"doctor: Hello, how are you doing today? patient: I'm feeling a little better, thank you. doctor: I'm glad to hear that. Can you tell me what brought you to the hospital? patient: I overdosed on citalopram and warfarin. doctor: I see.

If you need to take medication, we can try Prozac, which has been effective for you in the past. patient: Okay. doctor: I'm also going to refer you to a psychiatrist for further evaluation and treatment. patient: That's fine. doctor: I'm also going to recommend that you start taking Mirapex again.

"doctor: Hello, patient. Thank you for coming in today. I understand you're here for a dietary consultation for diabetes during your pregnancy. patient: Yes, that's right. I had gestational diabetes with my first pregnancy and had to use insulin. I'm not entirely sure what ketones are. doctor: I see. Well, ketones are produced when your body doesn't have enough insulin or enough calories. When this happens, your body starts to break down fat for energy, which produces ketones. This can lead to a condition called ketoacidosis, which can be dangerous. patient: That sounds serious. doctor: It can be, but we'll do everything we can to prevent that from happening. I've reviewed your blood sugar records for the last week, and your overall average is 140. We'll need to work on getting that number down. patient: Okay. What do I need to do? doctor: First, we need to adjust your insulin doses. I'm going to increase your morning dose from 20 units to 24 units and your evening dose from 13 units to 16 units. We'll also need to make some changes to your diet. patient: What kind of changes? doctor: We'll need to reduce your intake of refined carbohydrates, such as white bread, pasta, and rice. We'll also need to increase your intake of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. I've created a 2300-calorie meal plan for you that includes a carbohydrate budget of 45%. This means that about 45% of your daily calories should come from carbohydrates. patient: That sounds doable. doctor: I'm also going to ask you to start checking your blood sugar more frequently. I'd like you to call me at the end of the week if your fasting blood sugar is over 90 or your two-hour postprandial blood sugar is over 120. patient: I will. doctor: Good. I'm confident that we can get your diabetes under control and help you have a healthy pregnancy. patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Dietary consultation for diabetes during pregnancy.

"doctor: Hello, patient's parents. Thank you for bringing patient in today. I understand he's been having some rectal bleeding. Can you tell me more about what you've been seeing? patient's parent: Yes, it started about 2 days ago. He had a hard stool with bright red blood in it. Then, he had another episode yesterday and one again this morning, but this time the stool was soft and had dark red blood in it. doctor: Okay, and has he had any other symptoms, like fever, diarrhea, or easy bruising? patient's parent: No, he hasn't had any of those. doctor: I see. And how has his appetite been? patient's parent: He's been eating regular table food and drinking 24 ounces of milk a day. doctor: Okay, that's good. Now, I'm going to examine patient and then we'll talk about some tests that we can do to figure out what's causing the bleeding. The doctor examines patient. doctor: Patient's vital signs are all within normal limits. He's alert and active, and his abdomen is soft and nondistended. I didn't feel any masses when I palpated his abdomen. His rectal exam was deferred, but there were no perianal lesions. doctor: Based on patient's symptoms and my examination, I think there are a few possible causes for the bleeding. One possibility is a Meckel's diverticulum, which is a small pouch that can form in the small intestine. Another possibility is a polyp, which is a small growth that can grow in the colon or rectum. We also need to consider an infection or a vascular malformation. doctor: To help us figure out what's causing the bleeding, I'd like to order a Meckel scan today. If the Meckel scan is negative, we'll consider doing an upper endoscopy and a colonoscopy. We'll also start a colon clean out if the Meckel scan is negative. doctor: In addition, I'd like to send his stool for a C. diff toxin test and culture. I'd also like to order a blood test for a RAST test for cow's milk, soy, wheat, and egg allergies. doctor: We'll also monitor his hemoglobin levels. patient's parent: Okay, I understand.

Is that okay? patient: (nods) doctor: Let's start with your Coumadin therapy. You were started on Coumadin after your surgery to reduce the risk of blood clots, correct? patient: (nods) doctor: However, your prothrombin time and INR levels rose to supratherapeutic levels, even after Coumadin was discontinued. Is that right? patient: (nods) doctor: We're suspecting that you may have a hypersensitivity to Coumadin. Have you ever had a reaction to Coumadin or any other medications in the past? patient: (shakes head) doctor: I see. We've consulted with the hematology/oncology team, and they've recommended some further evaluation and management. We're going to give you an injection of vitamin K right now, as oral vitamin K is more effective but you're not able to take anything by mouth at the moment. We'll repeat your prothrombin time and INR levels in the morning. Once your levels are within a more therapeutic range, we'll start you on low-molecular-weight heparin, either Fragmin once a day or Lovenox twice a day, for 4 to 6 weeks after your surgery. patient: (nods) doctor: I understand this can be a lot to take in. We'll keep a close eye on you and make sure you're recovering well. Do you have any questions for me? patient: (shakes head) doctor: Okay. We'll be back to check on you soon.

Once her levels are within a more therapeutic range, she will be started on low-molecular-weight heparin, either Fragmin once a day or Lovenox twice a day, for 4 to 6 weeks after surgery. The patient understands the plan and has no questions at this time. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. Coumadin hypersensitivity Assessment: Patient experienced a supratherapeutic prothrombin time and INR level despite discontinuation of Coumadin, suggesting hypersensitivity to Coumadin. No history of hypersensitivity to other medications. Plan: - Administered vitamin K injection. - Will repeat prothrombin time and INR levels in the morning. - Once levels are within a more therapeutic range, will start patient on low-molecular-weight heparin, either Fragmin once a day or Lovenox twice a day, for 4 to 6 weeks after surgery. - Consulted with hematology/oncology team for further evaluation and management. 2. Total left knee arthroplasty Assessment: Patient is in the recovery phase after total left knee arthroplasty. She is drowsy due to morphine for pain control. Plan: - Continue monitoring patient's recovery and pain control. - Provide patient with instructions on post-operative care and rehabilitation. Follow-up instructions: - Patient will be seen in the clinic for follow-up in 2 weeks.","[{'phrase': 'up', 'label': 'AGE'}, {'phrase': 'total', 'label': 'DETAILED_DESCRIPTION'}, {'phrase': 'left knee', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'drowsy', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'morphine', 'label': 'MEDICATION'}, {'phrase': 'Co uma din', 'label': 'MEDICATION'}, {'phrase': 'Co uma din', 'label': 'MEDICATION'}, {'phrase': 'blood clots', 'label': 'DISEASE_DISORDER'}, {'phrase': 'pro thrombin time', 'label': 'DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE'}, {'phrase': 'INR', 'label': 'DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE'}, {'phrase': 'supra therapeutic levels', 'label': 'LAB_VALUE'}, {'phrase': 'Co uma din', 'label': 'MEDICATION'}, {'phrase': 'uma din', 'label': 'DETAILED_DESCRIPTION'}, {'phrase': 'hematology oncology', 'label': 'NONBIOLOGICAL_LOCATION'}, {'phrase': 'injection', 'label': 'ADMINISTRATION'}, {'phrase': 'vitamin K', 'label': 'MEDICATION'}, {'phrase': 'vitamin K', 'label': 'MEDICATION'}, {'phrase': 'pro thrombin time', 'label': 'DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE'}, {'phrase': 'INR', 'label': 'DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE'}, {'phrase': 'morning', 'label': 'DATE'}, {'phrase': 'low - molecular - weight', 'label': 'DETAILED_DESCRIPTION'}, {'phrase': 'heparin', 'label': 'MEDICATION'}, {'phrase': 'Frag min', 'label': 'MEDICATION'}, {'phrase': 'once a day', 'label': 'DOSAGE'}, {'phrase': 'Love nox', 'label': 'MEDICATION'}, {'phrase': 'twice a day', 'label': 'DOSAGE'}, {'phrase': '4 to 6', 'label': 'DURATION'}, {'phrase': 'weeks after', 'label': 'DATE'}]","[{'phrase': 'up', 'label': 'AGE'}, {'phrase': 'total', 'label': 'DETAILED_DESCRIPTION'}, {'phrase': 'left knee', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'drowsy', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'morphine', 'label': 'MEDICATION'}, {'phrase': 'Co uma din', 'label': 'MEDICATION'}, {'phrase': 'blood clots', 'label': 'DISEASE_DISORDER'}, {'phrase': 'pro thrombin time', 'label': 'DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE'}, {'phrase': 'INR', 'label': 'DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE'}, {'phrase': 'supra therapeutic levels', 'label': 'LAB_VALUE'}, {'phrase': 'uma din', 'label': 'DETAILED_DESCRIPTION'}, {'phrase': 'hematology oncology', 'label': 'NONBIOLOGICAL_LOCATION'}, {'phrase': 'injection', 'label': 'ADMINISTRATION'}, {'phrase': 'vitamin K', 'label': 'MEDICATION'}, {'phrase': 'morning', 'label': 'DATE'}, {'phrase': 'low - molecular - weight', 'label': 'DETAILED_DESCRIPTION'}, {'phrase': 'heparin', 'label': 'MEDICATION'}, {'phrase': 'Frag min', 'label': 'MEDICATION'}, {'phrase': 'once a day', 'label': 'DOSAGE'}, {'phrase': 'Love nox', 'label': 'MEDICATION'}, {'phrase': 'twice a day', 'label': 'DOSAGE'}, {'phrase': '4 to 6', 'label': 'DURATION'}, {'phrase': 'weeks after', 'label': 'DATE'}]","['up', 'total', 'left knee', 'drowsy', 'morphine', 'Co uma din', 'Co uma din', 'blood clots', 'pro thrombin time', 'INR', 'supra therapeutic levels', 'Co uma din', 'uma din', 'hematology oncology', 'injection', 'vitamin K', 'vitamin K', 'pro thrombin time', 'INR', 'morning', 'low - molecular - weight', 'heparin', 'Frag min', 'once a day', 'Love nox', 'twice a day', '4 to 6', 'weeks after']","['up', 'total', 'left knee', 'drowsy', 'morphine', 'Co uma din', 'blood clots', 'pro thrombin time', 'INR', 'supra therapeutic levels', 'uma din', 'hematology oncology', 'injection', 'vitamin K', 'morning', 'low - molecular - weight', 'heparin', 'Frag min', 'once a day', 'Love nox', 'twice a day', '4 to 6', 'weeks after']"

"doctor: Good morning, Ms. XYZ. How are you doing today? patient: I'm doing okay, Doctor. I'm here to see you about my neck, back, and leg pain. doctor: I see. Can you tell me more about your pain? patient: Well, I've been having neck pain for years. It's a constant, aching pain that sometimes shoots down my arms. I also have pain in my mid-back and lower back. The pain in my lower back is worse when I sit or stand for long periods of time. And I've been having pain in my right leg for the past few years. It's a sharp, burning pain that starts in my lower back and goes down to my foot. doctor: Have you seen any other doctors about this pain? patient: Yes, I've seen Dr. Ninan Matthew in the past. He diagnosed me with osteoarthritis, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia. I've also seen Dr. Bonaparte for my hyperlipidemia and hypothyroidism. doctor: I see. What treatments have you tried for your pain? patient: I've tried physical therapy, medication, and home remedies. Nothing seems to help. doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. I'm going to examine you today and see if I can find anything that might be causing your pain.

"doctor: Hello, patient, I'm doctor, the surgeon who will be evaluating you today. I understand you've been referred to me for a thyroid mass that was recently diagnosed as papillary carcinoma. Can you tell me a little bit more about your symptoms? patient: Sure. I first noticed a small lump in my thyroid about a year ago. It didn't bother me at first, but it started to get bigger recently. I went to the Pediatric Endocrinology Department, and they did a fine needle aspiration biopsy, which confirmed it was papillary thyroid carcinoma. doctor: I see. Have you experienced any other symptoms, such as hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, or weight changes? patient: No, I haven't had any of those symptoms. My weight has been stable, and I don't have any trouble swallowing or speaking. doctor: That's good to hear. Do you have any family history of thyroid cancer or other endocrine disorders? patient: Not that I know of. My father mentioned that his mother had thyroid surgery, but he's not sure if it was for cancer or goiter. doctor: Okay. I'll make a note of that. Now, let's take a closer look at your neck. (The doctor performs a physical examination of the patient's neck.) doctor: I can feel a slightly visible midline bulge in the region of the thyroid isthmus. There's also a firm nodule there, and some nodularity in the right lobe of the thyroid. The mass is relatively hard and slightly fixed, but it doesn't seem to be tethered to the surrounding tissues, skin, or muscles. I also noticed some shotty adenopathy in the area, but no supraclavicular nodes. patient: Does that mean the cancer has spread? doctor: It's possible, but we can't be sure until we do some further testing. I'd like to order a chest x-ray and review your laboratory data from the Diagnostics Lab. patient: Okay. (The doctor orders the tests and reviews the patient's medical history.) doctor: I see that you have a mild abnormality in your AST levels, but your T4, TSH, and free thyroxine levels are all normal. Your serum pregnancy test is also negative. Unfortunately, there's no level of thyroglobulin recorded on this. patient: What does all that mean? doctor: Well, the AST abnormality is not a major concern, but it's something we'll want to keep an eye on. The normal T4, TSH, and free thyroxine levels indicate that your thyroid is still functioning properly. The negative pregnancy test is important because we can't use radioactive iodine therapy if you're pregnant. And the thyroglobulin level is a marker for thyroid cancer, so we'll need to get that checked as soon as possible. patient: I see. doctor: Now, let's talk about the chest x-ray. The radiologist noted a diffuse pattern of tiny nodules in both lungs, which is typical of miliary metastatic disease that is often seen in patients with metastatic thyroid carcinoma. This is unfortunate because it generally means a more advanced stage of disease. patient: (Visibly upset) Oh no. Does that mean the cancer has spread to my lungs? doctor: It's possible, but we can't be sure until we do a biopsy. I'll need to discuss this with the oncology team and see what they recommend. (The doctor spends the next 30 minutes discussing the surgical aspects of the treatment with the patient and her family.) doctor: I recommend performing a total thyroidectomy to remove the primary source of the cancer and eradicate as much of the native thyroid tissue as possible. We'll also do a sentinel node dissection to check for the spread of cancer to the lymph nodes. patient: What are the risks of surgery? doctor: There are a few potential risks, including damage to the recurrent laryngeal and external laryngeal branches of the nerve supplying the vocal cord function, which could lead to hoarseness or difficulty speaking. There's also a risk of hypoparathyroidism if all four of the parathyroid glands are damaged during the operation, which could lead to low calcium levels and other complications. patient: That's a lot to take in. doctor: I understand. This is a lot to process, and I'm here to answer any questions you have. (The doctor and the patient's family continue to discuss the surgery and the potential risks and benefits.) doctor: I've made every effort to get you scheduled for surgery within the next 48 hours. We're tentatively planning on proceeding this upcoming Friday afternoon with total thyroidectomy. In the meantime, I'll order the necessary tests and consult with the oncology team to discuss the best course of treatment. patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help. doctor: You're welcome. I'll see you again before the surgery to answer any additional questions you may have.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Thyroid mass evaluation.

"doctor: Good morning, Mr. patient, I'm Dr. doctor. I understand you're here for evaluation of your pneumothorax and subcutaneous emphysema. Can you tell me a little bit about what's been going on? patient: Sure. It all started on Monday when I had this sharp pain in my shoulder blade. I went to the emergency room, and they did a CT scan that showed I had a small pneumothorax and a lot of subcutaneous emphysema. They admitted me for observation. doctor: I see. And how have you been feeling since then? patient: The pain in my shoulder blade has gotten better, but my voice has been hoarse, and I still have some shortness of breath. doctor: Okay. I'm going to examine you now. The doctor performs a physical exam. doctor: Your lungs sound clear, and your heart rate and rhythm are regular. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. And your skin shows significant subcutaneous emphysema in the upper chest and anterior neck area, although you say it's improved since yesterday. patient: Yes, it's definitely gotten better. doctor: That's good to hear. I've reviewed your CT scan results, and I agree with the radiologist's impression that you have a small pneumothorax and subcutaneous emphysema. The most likely cause is either a parenchymal lung tear or a small tracheobronchial tree rend. patient: What does that mean? doctor: It means that there's a tear in the lining of your lung or in the small airways. This can happen from trauma, like a fall or a car accident. patient: I haven't had any accidents recently. doctor: It's possible that the tear happened spontaneously. This is more common in people who have certain lung conditions, like emphysema or asthma. Do you have any history of lung problems? patient: No, I don't. doctor: Okay. Well, we're going to consult with the CT Surgery and Pulmonary services to get their recommendations. In the meantime, we'll continue to monitor you and treat your symptoms. patient: Okay. Thank you, doctor. doctor: You're welcome.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Evaluation of pneumothorax and subcutaneous emphysema.

"doctor: Hello, patient. Thank you for coming in today. I understand you've been experiencing some unusual spells recently. Can you tell me more about what's been happening? patient (father): Sure. Patient's name has been having these brief periods where she pauses and stares. She becomes unresponsive, but she doesn't lose her balance or fall. doctor: How long do these spells typically last? patient (mother): They vary. I've seen them last anywhere from 10 to 15 seconds, but patient's father says they can last up to 3 or 4 minutes. doctor: I see. Have you noticed anything else unusual during these spells, like any changes in her breathing or skin color? patient (mother): Yes, actually. During one of the spells outside a store recently, her lips turned blue for a few seconds. But she's never had any convulsions or shaking. doctor: That's important information. Now, I'd like to ask you a few questions about patient's name's medical history. She has a history of febrile seizures, correct? patient (father): Yes, that's right. She's been taking Keppra to prevent them, and it's been working well. doctor: I see. Has there been any change in her Keppra dosage recently? patient (mother): No, she's still taking the same dose, 150 mg twice a day. doctor: Okay. I'd like to perform a physical examination to gather more information. If that's alright with you. patient (parents): Sure, go ahead. doctor: (Conducts physical examination) doctor: Based on your symptoms and examination findings, I believe patient's name may be experiencing partial complex seizures or possibly nonconvulsive generalized seizures. We'll need to do an EEG to confirm the diagnosis. patient (father): What's an EEG? doctor: An EEG is a test that records the electrical activity in the brain. It can help us identify any abnormal patterns that may be causing the seizures. patient (mother): Will patient's name need to be sedated for the EEG? doctor: It depends. If she tolerates the procedure well, we may not need to sedate her. However, if she becomes agitated or uncomfortable, we may need to give her a mild sedative to help her relax. patient (father): Okay. What are the next steps? doctor: First, we'll try to capture an EEG as long as patient's name tolerates it. If sedation is needed, we'll defer the EEG until we adjust her seizure medications and see how she responds. I'm also increasing her Keppra dosage to 300 mg twice a day, bringing her total daily dose to just under 40 mg/kg per day. We may increase it further if the spells continue. patient (mother): When will we know the results of the EEG? doctor: I hope to review the findings first thing tomorrow morning. However, I won't delay discharging patient's name to wait for the results. We'll contact you as outpatients once we have them. patient (father): And when should we follow up with you? doctor: I'd like to see patient's name again in 5 to 6 weeks to check on her progress and schedule further follow-up appointments as needed. patient (parents): Thank you, doctor. We appreciate your help. doctor: You're welcome. I'm here if you have any questions or concerns.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Seizure-like spells.

"doctor: Good morning, Mr. patient. I understand you're here for a newly diagnosed case of high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia? patient: Yes, that's right. doctor: I see you were transferred here from another hospital. Can you tell me a little bit about what led up to this diagnosis? patient: Well, it all started back in October when I noticed swelling and discomfort in my left testicle. It felt like there was a lump in the back of it. The pain would come and go, but it never completely went away. doctor: And then in November, you started having pain in your upper right leg. patient: Yes, that's right. At first, I thought it was just from skateboarding or a muscle strain. I went to physical therapy, and it helped for a while. But then in December, I started getting really tired. I couldn't work out like I used to, and I lost 10 pounds. I also started having night sweats and a cough. doctor: I see. And you were treated with Augmentin for those symptoms? patient: Yes, but they didn't really help. I also started taking Accutane for my acne, but I stopped that a few days ago. doctor: Okay. So then on February 19th, you woke up with severe pain in your right groin and lower quadrant. patient: Yes, that's right. It was so bad that I went to the emergency room. They did a CT scan and found a large clot in my inferior vena cava. I had surgery to place a vena caval filter and remove the clot. doctor: I see. And you've been on continuous intravenous unfractionated heparin infusion since then. patient: Yes, that's right. doctor: Well, Mr. patient, I'm afraid I have some news for you. The results of your blood tests and PET/CT scan came back, and they confirmed the diagnosis of precursor-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia. patient: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia? What does that mean? doctor: It's a type of cancer that starts in the bone marrow. It's the most common type of leukemia in children, but it can also occur in adults. patient: But I'm only 20 years old. I don't understand. doctor: I know this is a lot to take in. But we're going to do everything we can to help you. We're going to start with a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, as well as a lumbar puncture. These procedures will help us learn more about the leukemia and develop a treatment plan. patient: Okay. What else can I do? doctor: Well, we're also going to need to reassess the status of the deep venous thrombosis with Doppler studies. And we'll do an ultrasound/Doppler of your testicles to check for the epididymitis. patient: Okay. I'll do whatever it takes. doctor: I know this is a lot to take in, but I want to assure you that we're here to help you. We're going to work together to get you through this.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Newly diagnosed high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a 20-year-old male who presents to the clinic for a newly diagnosed case of high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia. He was transferred from another hospital for further evaluation and treatment. The patient initially noticed swelling and discomfort in his left testicle in October 2022. The pain was intermittent but did not resolve completely. In November 2022, he developed pain in his upper right leg. He was initially treated with physical therapy, which provided temporary relief. In December 2022, he began experiencing fatigue, weight loss, night sweats, and cough. He was prescribed Augmentin for these symptoms, but they did not improve. He also started taking Accutane for his acne, but discontinued it a few days prior to this visit. On February 19, 2023, he woke up with severe pain in his right groin and lower quadrant. He went to the emergency room, where a CT scan revealed a large clot in his inferior vena cava. He underwent surgery to place a vena caval filter and remove the clot. He has been receiving continuous intravenous unfractionated heparin infusion since then. The patient's blood tests and PET/CT scan confirmed the diagnosis of precursor-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia. He is scheduled for a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, lumbar puncture, Doppler studies to reassess the status of the deep venous thrombosis, and an ultrasound/Doppler of his testicles to check for epididymitis.

"doctor: Hello, patient, thank you for coming in today. I understand you're here for further evaluation and management of your hypertension. patient: Yes, that's right. I've also been experiencing severe backache due to a disc herniation. I've seen an orthopedic doctor and am scheduled for surgery. I'm here today for surgical clearance. doctor: I see. Can you tell me more about your backache? How long have you been experiencing it, and what kind of pain are you feeling? patient: It started about a year ago. The pain is sharp and stabbing, and it gets worse when I move around. It's also been difficult to sleep at night. doctor: I understand. I'll take a look at your back and see if I can find anything that might be causing the pain. (Examines the patient's back) Okay, I don't see anything that looks obviously wrong. I'm going to order an MRI to get a better look at your spine. patient: Thank you. I'm also concerned about my heart health. I had a cardiac cath about four years ago, and it was essentially normal. But I've been feeling short of breath lately, even with just a little bit of exertion. I also have two-pillow orthopnea and intermittent pedal edema. doctor: Okay, I'll listen to your heart and lungs and check your blood pressure. (Examines the patient's heart and lungs) Your heart sounds good, and your lungs are clear. Your blood pressure is a little high today at 135/70. I'm going to order an echocardiogram and a stress test to get a better look at your heart. I'm also going to order some routine blood tests. patient: Okay. I'm also concerned about my sleep apnea. I was diagnosed with it a few years ago, but I don't use a CPAP mask. doctor: I understand. Sleep apnea can definitely contribute to your high blood pressure and heart problems. I'm going to order a sleep apnea study to see if you still have it. patient: Thank you. I appreciate your help. doctor: You're welcome. I'm going to have my nurse give you a requisition for the tests. I'll see you again in two weeks to go over the results.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Hypertension and backache.

"doctor: Good morning, Mr. Patient. I understand you were brought to the Emergency Room following an episode of fainting, is that correct? patient: Yes, that's right. I passed out suddenly and my family called 911. doctor: Do you recall any symptoms before you fainted? Any chest pain or shortness of breath? patient: No, I didn't have any chest pain or shortness of breath.

Your heart rate is regular, your blood pressure is a little high, but your lungs are clear and your abdomen is soft and nontender. doctor: I've also reviewed your lab results. Your blood counts are stable, your BUN and creatinine are within normal limits, and your cardiac enzyme profile is negative. However, your ammonia level is elevated. patient: What does that mean? doctor: An elevated ammonia level can indicate a problem with your liver or kidneys. We'll need to do some more tests to determine the cause. doctor: I've also ordered a CT angiogram of your chest to rule out a pulmonary embolism and a CT of your head to look for any abnormalities. patient: Okay. doctor: I'm going to admit you to the hospital for further evaluation. We'll need to monitor your condition and run some more tests to determine the cause of your syncopal episode and possible seizure. patient: I understand. doctor: I'll keep you updated on the results of your tests and we'll discuss the next steps in your treatment plan once we have more information. patient: Thank you, doctor.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Syncopal episode.

"doctor: Good morning, Mr. patient. How are you doing today? patient: I'm doing okay, doctor. I'm here for my knee replacement surgery. doctor: I see. Can you tell me a little bit about your knee pain? patient: It's been going on for a couple of years now. It started as a clicking noise and stiffness, but it's gotten worse over time. Now, I have pain all the time, even when I'm just walking around the house. doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Have you tried any treatments for your knee pain? patient: I've tried physical therapy and pain medication, but nothing has helped. doctor: I see. Well, I think you're a good candidate for a total knee replacement. This is a surgery where we replace the damaged parts of your knee with artificial components. patient: What does that involve? doctor: Well, we'll make an incision in your knee and remove the damaged cartilage and bone. Then, we'll insert the artificial components. The surgery usually takes about two hours, and you'll stay in the hospital for a few days afterwards. patient: How long will it take me to recover? doctor: It takes most people about six to eight weeks to recover from a total knee replacement. During that time, you'll need to do physical therapy to help you regain your strength and range of motion. patient: That sounds like a lot of work. doctor: It is, but it's worth it. A total knee replacement can give you significant pain relief and improve your quality of life. patient: I'm still not sure. I'll need to think about it. doctor: That's fine. Take some time to talk to your family and friends, and do some research online. I'll be here if you have any questions. patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Knee pain.

and your and your diet and exercise patient yeah i i check my sugar two or three times a week most of the time it's in that one twenty to one forty range doctor okay patient yeah i take my medicine okay my diet is alright you know i could be fifteen pounds lighter that would be alright but doctor sure patient i i i think the sugar has been okay doctor okay we checked your hemoglobin a1c last time i'm looking at your records in epic and it showed that it was you know seven . one so it's it's it's good but it could be better any you know we talked about it controlling your diet or improving your diet and trying to have a balanced meal and not eating some of these sweets and high sugar items how is that going i know you had talked about your wife being a great cook and making cookies and that's hard to stay away from obviously how are things going with that patient yeah she still makes cookies and i still eat them but you know we are trying to trying to do better trying to stay away from more of those carbs and focus on you know less carby less sweet stuff doctor okay alright yeah that's always a struggle i certainly understand but you know really important with your diabetes just to prevent some of the complications like kidney failure and eye problems and just keep your sugar under balance so i'll order another hemoglobin a1c today we'll check that again today and and you know just reemphasizing the controlling your diet and exercise is super important and then we'll have those results back we'll we'll see if we need to make any modifications okay patient okay doctor for your high blood pressure your blood pressure in the clinic looks pretty good it's about one twenty over seventy right now we have you on norvasc five milligrams once a day how are things going with that are you are you checking that periodically or any issues with that at all patient yeah i guess i check it maybe once a week or two or three times a month and it it the vast majority of the time when i check it it's good usually either that one twenty to one thirty over seventy to eighty range i i think the blood pressure's okay doctor okay patient i have n't had any real problems there i i have had some some swelling in my ankles though doctor okay is that new or is that been going on for a while patient well it it started maybe i do n't know a month or two after i started the norvasc doctor okay patient and i was just wondering if the two might be related doctor yeah i mean certainly it could be it is you know sometimes that medication can cause that so i'll i'll examine you in a second and see if we need to make any modifications okay patient okay doctor alright so and your anything else bothering you today patient no i'm we're doing okay i think doctor so let me examine you for a second i'm gon na go ahead and gabriel i'm gon na do my magic exam now let's pretend i i'm just gon na verbalize some of my findings as i do my exam and so patient these are like my video visit exams doctor exactly so your neck exam has no jvd there is no bruits that i can hear your lung exam no rales no wheezing on your heart exam you do have a two over six systolic ejection murmur you had that in the past so i'm not too worried about that otherwise regular rate and rhythm on your heart exam on your on your on your belly exam is nice and soft on your back exam you do have some tenderness on the left paraspinal area right where i'm pressing right there your straight leg raise test is negative your reflexes are normal you have some just some tenderness in the lower back in the paraspinal area of your back when i palpate there otherwise your neurological exam is normal on your extremity exam you do have this one plus nonpitting edema of your lower extremities which is a little bit of swelling in your ankles no calf tenderness negative homans sign no signs of blood clot that's what that means so let me just review what you know explain what all this means so the back pain the first problem that you're here today for i think this is more of a muscular sprain i'm gon na recommend we start you on some anti-inflammatory naprosyn five hundred five hundred milligrams twice a day and flexeril ten milligrams twice a day as well i'm gon na refer you to for for physical therapy to help strengthen some of the muscles in your lower back i do n't think you need an x-ray at this stage why do n't we start with physical therapy and the muscle relaxers and the pain medicines if it does n't get better then we can get an x-ray but right now i would start with that if that's okay with you any questions about that patient no doctor okay for the diabetes the the second problem that we talked about today i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c continue the metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day why do n't we have you come back in about two weeks and we should have some of the results back and we can discuss if we need to make any modifications for that but right now we will continue the course and we will go from there okay for the high blood pressure you do have this one plus edema in your legs i'm gon na go ahead and order some blood work today i'm gon na go ahead and stop the norvasc and we'll put you on some hydrochlorothiazide ten milligrams once a day and if that does n't get if the swelling does n't go away i'm gon na do some more testing for right now let's get some sort off with some cbc and a bmp i'm gon na check your kidney function i'm gon na get another ekg and also i'm gon na get a chest x-ray and we'll go from there but

He sustained an acute back injury four days ago while working in the yard, lifting something heavy. He describes the pain as sharp and radiating down his left leg. He denies any weakness or numbness in his legs, but he reports tingling in certain positions. He denies any loss of bowel or bladder function. He has no history of back surgeries or back problems, but he has experienced occasional back pain in the past. He has tried ibuprofen for pain, which provided some relief. The patient also has a history of diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He is currently taking metformine 500 mg twice a day for diabetes, norvasc 5 mg once a day for hypertension, and niacin for hyperlipidemia. He reports that his blood sugar levels are generally between 120 and 140 mg/dL, and his hemoglobin A1c was 7.1% at his last check. He admits to eating sweets and high-sugar items but is trying to improve his diet. He checks his blood pressure periodically and reports that it is usually between 120/70 and 130/80 mmHg. However, he has noticed some swelling in his ankles, which started about a month or two after starting norvasc. The patient denies any other current complaints. He reports that he is generally doing well. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. Low back pain Assessment: Based on the patient's description of pain radiating down his left leg, tenderness on the left paraspinal area, and negative straight leg raise test, the most likely diagnosis is a muscular sprain. Plan: - Naprosyn 500mg twice a day for pain - Flexeril 10mg twice a day for muscle relaxation - Physical therapy referral to strengthen lower back muscles - If symptoms persist or worsen, consider X-ray. 2. Diabetes Assessment: Patient's hemoglobin A1c is 7.1%, indicating suboptimal control. He is compliant with metformin 500mg twice a day and reports generally maintaining blood sugar levels between 120-140 mg/dL. Plan: - Continue metformin 500mg twice a day - Order repeat hemoglobin A1c - Reemphasize the importance of controlling diet and exercise to improve blood sugar control - Follow up in 2 weeks to review hemoglobin A1c results and consider medication adjustments if necessary. 3. Hypertension Assessment: Patient's blood pressure is well-controlled in clinic, typically ranging from 120/70 to 130/80 mmHg. He has recently experienced ankle swelling, possibly related to norvasc. Plan: - Discontinue norvasc 5mg once a day - Start hydrochlorothiazide 10mg once a day - Order CBC, BMP, EKG, and chest X-ray to evaluate for underlying causes of ankle swelling - Follow up in 2 weeks to assess response to hydrochlorothiazide and address any persistent swelling or other concerns. Follow-up instructions: - Return to the clinic in 2 weeks for follow-up of diabetes, hypertension, and back pain. - If symptoms worsen or new concerns arise, contact the clinic sooner.","[{'phrase': 'wheezing', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'two over', 'label': 'DETAILED_DESCRIPTION'}, {'phrase': 'six', 'label': 'LAB_VALUE'}, {'phrase': 'systolic', 'label': 'DETAILED_DESCRIPTION'}, {'phrase': 'murmur', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'tenderness', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'para spinal area', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'straight leg raise test', 'label': 'DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE'}, {'phrase': 'negative', 'label': 'LAB_VALUE'}, {'phrase': 'reflexes', 'label': 'DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE'}, {'phrase': 'normal', 'label': 'LAB_VALUE'}, {'phrase': 'tenderness', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'lower back', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'para spinal area of back', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'neurological exam', 'label': 'DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE'}, {'phrase': 'normal', 'label': 'LAB_VALUE'}, {'phrase': 'extremity exam', 'label': 'DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE'}, {'phrase': 'non pit ting', 'label': 'DETAILED_DESCRIPTION'}, {'phrase': 'edema', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'lower extremities', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'swelling', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'ankles', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'calf', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'tenderness', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'negative', 'label': 'LAB_VALUE'}, {'phrase': 'ho man s sign', 'label': 'DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE'}, {'phrase': 'blood', 'label': 'DISEASE_DISORDER'}, {'phrase': 'clot', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'back', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'pain', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'muscular', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'sprain', 'label': 'DISEASE_DISORDER'}, {'phrase': 'anti -

We'll have to see how you respond to it. patient: Okay. doctor: I know this is a lot to take in, but I want to assure you that we're going to do everything we can to help you feel better. patient: Thank you, doctor.

"doctor: Good morning, Mrs. patient. I understand you've been experiencing some syncopal episodes. Can you tell me more about what's been going on? patient: Well, I was shopping the other day when I suddenly felt this intense abdominal discomfort and nausea. I started sweating profusely and then I just passed out. doctor: How long did you lose consciousness for? patient: It wasn't long, maybe a few seconds. But when I came to, I was lying on the floor and my daughter had my legs elevated. doctor: Did you feel confused or disoriented after the episode? patient: No, not at all. I was completely alert and oriented as soon as I woke up. doctor: That's good to hear. Now, your daughter mentioned that you've had episodes of weakness, but no syncope. Can you elaborate on that? patient: Yes, I've been feeling weak and lightheaded at times, but I haven't actually fainted until the other day. doctor: I see. And you mentioned that you have a history of pulmonary embolism. Can you tell me more about that? patient: Yes, I had a pulmonary embolism a few years ago. I had a similar syncopal episode at that time. I was admitted to the hospital and had a V/Q scan, which came back positive for PE. doctor: Interesting. And what treatment did you receive for the pulmonary embolism? patient: I was anticoagulated with Coumadin, but I had a severe GI bleed as a result. So, the anticoagulation was stopped and an IVC filter was placed. doctor: I see. That's quite a history. Now, let's talk about your current medications. You mentioned that you take aspirin, Klor-Con, Lasix, Levothyroxine, Lisinopril, Pacerone, Protonix, Toprol, Vitamin B, Zetia, and Zyrtec. Is that correct? patient: Yes, that's all correct. doctor: Okay. I'm going to order some tests to help us figure out what's causing your syncopal episodes. I'd like to do a blood test, an EKG, and a chest X-ray. patient: Sure, I'm happy to do whatever it takes to get to the bottom of this. doctor: I appreciate that. I'll also refer you to a cardiologist for further evaluation. They may recommend a stress test or other specialized tests. patient: Okay, I'll follow up with them. doctor: Good. In the meantime, I want you to be cautious about activities that might trigger an episode, such as standing for long periods of time or lifting heavy objects. If you feel lightheaded or weak, lie down immediately and elevate your legs. patient: I will. Thank you for your help, doctor. doctor: You're welcome. I'm here if you have any questions or concerns.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Syncopal episode.

Have you had any other symptoms, like chills, shortness of breath, or a cough? patient: No, nothing like that. Just the fever and the pain in my ankle. doctor: Okay. I'm going to take a look at your ankle and then we'll talk about some treatment options. doctor: (Examines the patient's ankle) Your ankle is definitely swollen and red, and there's a lot of drainage coming from the ulcer. It's also warm to the touch, which is a sign of infection. patient: Ouch! That hurts! doctor: I'm sorry. I know that's painful. I'm going to order some blood cultures and wound cultures to see what kind of bacteria is causing the infection. I'm also going to start you on some antibiotics right away. patient: Okay. What kind of antibiotics? doctor: I'm going to give you daptomycin and Primaxin IV.

Can you tell me a little bit about what happened? patient: Sure. I had a brain tumor removed on October 24th, 2008, and after that, I had left-sided weakness. I started physical therapy on November 5th, but then on December 5th, I was admitted to the hospital because they found massive swelling on my brain. I had a second surgery and then stayed in acute rehab until January 5th, 2009. doctor: I see. And during rehabilitation, you had a DVT in your left calf, is that right? patient: Yes, that's right. But it has since been resolved. doctor: That's good to hear. Now, you mentioned that your primary concern is your left-sided weakness, particularly with your balance, walking, and left arm. Is that correct? patient: Yes, that's right. I want to be able to walk and move around more easily. doctor: I understand. I'm going to perform some tests to assess your strength, balance, and gait. The doctor performs the range of motion, strength, balance, and gait tests. doctor: Based on my examination, you have deficits in strength, balance, and ambulation. You will benefit from skilled physical therapy to address these impairments. patient: What will that involve? doctor: The treatment plan will include therapeutic exercise, balance training, gait training, and functional mobility training. We'll start with three sessions per week for four weeks and then reduce it to two sessions per week for an additional four weeks. patient: Okay. doctor: I've set some short-term and long-term goals for you. In the short term, I'd like you to be able to tolerate 30 repetitions of all lower extremity exercises, improve your balance with a score of 50/56 points, and ambulate 1000 feet in a 6-minute walk test with standby assist. In the long term, I'd like you to be able to ambulate independently within your home and standby to general supervision within the community, achieve a Berg balance test score of 52/56, ambulate a 6-minute walk test for 1500 feet independently including safe negotiation of corners and busy areas, and demonstrate safely stepping over and around objects without loss of balance. patient: Those sound like good goals. doctor: I'm confident that we can achieve these goals with hard work and dedication. patient: I'm ready to do whatever it takes. doctor: That's great to hear.

"doctor: Good morning, patient. I'm Dr. doctor, and I'll be your physician today. I understand you've been experiencing some health issues lately. Can you tell me a little bit about what's been going on? patient: Sure, doctor. It all started a few months ago when I noticed swelling and discomfort in my left testicle. It's been painful off and on ever since. Then, in November, I started having pain in my upper right leg. I thought it was from skateboarding, but it didn't go away. doctor: I see. And when did you start feeling more fatigued? patient: In December, I noticed I was getting tired more easily. I used to work out regularly, but I didn't have the energy anymore. I've also lost 10 pounds since then, and my appetite has decreased. doctor: That's concerning. Did you experience any other symptoms? patient: Yes, I had night sweats and a cough in December. I was treated with Augmentin, but they didn't go away. I also started taking Accutane for acne in December, but I stopped on February 19th. doctor: I see. Now, let's talk about the more recent events. You mentioned you had severe pain in your right groin and lower quadrant on February 19th. What happened then? patient: I woke up with severe pain and went to the emergency room. They found an elevated white blood cell count and did a CT scan of my abdomen. The scan showed a large clot in my inferior vena cava extending to my right iliac and femoral veins. doctor: That sounds serious. What happened next? patient: I underwent angioplasty, placement of a vena caval filter, and mechanical and pharmacologic thrombolysis. A repeat ultrasound on February 20th showed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis. doctor: That's good news. So, you're currently taking Lovenox, Coumadin, Protonix, Vicodin, and Levaquin. Are there any allergies or past surgeries I should be aware of? patient: No known drug allergies, but I do seem to react to certain adhesives. As for past surgeries, I had the thrombosis treatment on February 19th and 20th. doctor: Okay, I've made a note of that. Now, let's discuss your family history. Do you have any relatives with medical conditions? patient: My maternal great-grandmother had deep venous thrombosis in her 40s, and my maternal great-uncle developed leukemia around age 50. My paternal grandfather died of colon cancer at age 73, and adult-onset diabetes runs in both sides of my family. doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. I'll make sure to document it in your medical record. Now, let's move on to your social history. You mentioned you're a student at the University of Denver. What are your living arrangements like? patient: I live in a dorm on campus. My parents live in Breckenridge. I admit to occasionally smoking marijuana and drinking beer with friends. doctor: I understand. Now, let's talk about your current symptoms. You mentioned nausea and constipation related to Vicodin and pain medication. You also have mild to moderate acne. Do you have any other symptoms, like shortness of breath, chest pain, headaches, joint pains, rashes, or extremity pain? patient: No, I don't have any of those symptoms, except for the right leg pain. doctor: That's good to hear. I've reviewed your physical examination results, and I'd like to order some tests to further assess your condition. We'll do a diagnostic bone marrow aspirate/biopsy and lumbar puncture. We'll also do a Doppler study to reassess the status of the deep venous thrombosis and an ultrasound/Doppler of the testicles. patient: Okay, doctor. I'll cooperate with the tests. doctor: That's great. We'll proceed with the diagnostic procedures as soon as it's safe to do so, considering your anticoagulation status. In the meantime, we'll maintain therapeutic anticoagulation. patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help. doctor: You're welcome, patient. We're here to help you get better.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Evaluation of post-thrombotic right leg pain.

"doctor: Good morning, Mr./Ms. patient, I'm Dr. doctor. I understand you've been experiencing nausea and right upper quadrant pain since yesterday evening. Can you tell me more about what's been going on? patient: Sure. I had gastric bypass surgery about a year ago and I've been doing well until yesterday evening around 7:00-8:00 when I started feeling nauseous and had pain in my right upper quadrant. The pain wrapped around to my right side and back. It feels like I'm going to vomit, but I haven't. I also feel overall malaise and have a low-grade temperature of 100.3. I haven't had any similar symptoms before. My last normal bowel movement was yesterday. I don't have any chills or blood per rectum. doctor: I see. Do you have any history of medical conditions or surgeries? patient: I have a history of hypertension and morbid obesity, but those have been resolved since my gastric bypass surgery in December 2007. doctor: That's good to hear. Are you taking any medications or have any allergies? patient: I take multivitamins and calcium. I don't have any known allergies. doctor: Okay. Do you have any family history of medical conditions? patient: My father had diabetes mellitus, but he passed away. doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Do you smoke or drink alcohol? patient: No, I don't. I work in a data entry computer job. doctor: Alright. I'm going to perform a physical exam now. The doctor performs a physical exam. doctor: Your temperature is 100.3, blood pressure is 129/59, respirations are 16, and heart rate is 84. You are drowsy, but easily arousable and appropriate with conversation. You are oriented to person, place, and situation. Your sclerae are anicteric. Your mucous membranes are somewhat tacky. Your neck is supple and symmetric. Your respirations are unlabored and clear. Your heart has a regular rate and rhythm. Your abdomen is soft. You have diffuse right upper quadrant tenderness, worse focally, but no rebound or guarding. You have no organomegaly, masses, or abdominal hernias. Your extremities are symmetrical with no edema. Your posterior tibial pulses are palpable and symmetric. You are grossly nonfocal neurologically. doctor: Based on your symptoms and physical exam findings, I believe you have choledocholithiasis, possibly with cholecystitis. We'll need to admit you to the hospital and start you on IV antibiotics. We'll also get an ultrasound this morning to confirm the diagnosis. You will need your gallbladder removed, probably with an intraoperative cholangiogram. Hopefully, the stone will pass this way. Due to your anatomy, an ERCP would be difficult if not impossible unless laparoscopic assisted. Dr. X will see you later this morning to discuss the plan further. patient: Okay, I understand. Thank you for explaining everything to me.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Nausea and right upper quadrant pain.

"doctor: Hello, Mr./Ms. Patient, thank you for coming in today. I understand you're here because you're having some issues with your colostomy. patient: That's right. I had a colostomy placed 9 days ago after having part of my colon removed due to cancer. Earlier today, I started feeling nauseated, and my colostomy stopped filling up. I also had this burning sensation in my chest. doctor: I see. Have you been vomiting or had diarrhea? patient: No, I haven't vomited, but I've been feeling nauseous. I also haven't had diarrhea. doctor: Okay. Do you have any abdominal pain or fever? patient: No, I don't have any pain or fever. doctor: Alright. I'm going to examine you now. (The doctor performs a physical examination.) doctor: Your vital signs are all normal. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender, and your bowel sounds are decreased and high-pitched. I can see your colostomy port, and there's no obvious impaction or infection. patient: That's good to hear. doctor: I'm a little concerned about your symptoms, though. The fact that your colostomy has stopped filling up and you're feeling nauseous could be a sign of a bowel obstruction. patient: A bowel obstruction? What does that mean? doctor: A bowel obstruction is when there's a blockage in your intestines that prevents stool from passing through. This can cause nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. In some cases, it can also lead to serious complications. patient: That sounds serious. What can we do about it? doctor: Well, first, I'm going to order an abdominal X-ray to confirm the diagnosis. If the X-ray shows that you have a bowel obstruction, we'll need to admit you to the hospital for observation. patient: Okay. I'll do whatever it takes to get better. doctor: That's the spirit. I'll be back shortly with the results of your X-ray. (The doctor leaves the room and returns a few minutes later.) doctor: The X-ray confirmed that you have a bowel obstruction. We're going to admit you to the hospital for observation. We'll also start you on IV fluids and antibiotics. patient: Alright. Thank you for your help. doctor: You're welcome. We'll do everything we can to get you feeling better.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Evaluation of colostomy and nausea.

"doctor: Good morning, Mr. ABC. How are you doing today? patient: I'm doing alright, doctor. I'm here because I've been having trouble with my vision lately. doctor: I see. Can you tell me more about that? patient: Well, over the past year, I've noticed that I'm having difficulty seeing things far away, especially when I'm driving. I'm also having trouble reading fine print up close. doctor: I understand. Do you wear glasses or contact lenses? patient: I used to wear glasses for astigmatism, but I haven't worn them in the last few years. doctor: Okay. I'm going to take a look at your eyes and see if I can find anything that might be causing your vision problems. doctor: (Examines Mr. ABC's eyes) Your visual acuity is 20/20 in your right eye and 20/40 in your left eye. Your near vision is J2 in both eyes. Your pupils are equal and reactive to light. Your extraocular movements are normal. Your intraocular pressure is 16 mmHg in your right eye and 18 mmHg in your left eye. patient: What does all that mean? doctor: Well, your visual acuity is a measure of how well you can see objects at different distances. Your near vision is how well you can see objects up close. Your pupils are the black circles in the center of your eyes. They get bigger or smaller to let more or less light into your eyes. Your extraocular movements are how well your eyes can move in different directions. Your intraocular pressure is the pressure inside your eyes. patient: Okay. So, what's wrong with my eyes? doctor: Well, I see some signs of age-related macular degeneration in your right eye. This is a condition that affects the macula, which is the part of your retina that is responsible for central vision. I also see some signs of glaucoma suspect in both eyes. This is a condition that can damage the optic nerve, which is responsible for sending signals from your eyes to your brain. patient: What can we do about it? doctor: Well, for the age-related macular degeneration, I'm going to recommend that you start taking Ocuvite PreserVision capulets twice a day. This is a supplement that can help to slow the progression of the disease. For the glaucoma suspect, I'm going to order a Humphrey visual field test and some disc photographs. These tests will help us to monitor your condition and make sure that it's not getting worse. I'm also going to refer you to the Glaucoma Clinic for further evaluation and treatment. patient: Okay. I'll do whatever it takes to get my vision back. doctor: I'm glad to hear that. I'm confident that we can help you. patient: Thank you, doctor.

doctor hey nicholas nice to see you today your pcp looks like he sent you over for a nonhealing foot ulcer on your right foot can you tell me about how long you've had that patient yeah i've had the boot for about six weeks i first noticed it when i put on a pair of shoes that were little bit too tight i felt some burning and some stinging and looked down and saw a blister i did n't think too much of it because it was on the pad of the bottom of my foot around my heel and i just had been walking on the front part of my foot i started to notice a foul smell and my wife mentioned something to me the other day and i noticed my dog was also smelling my socks a lot and so we looked and saw that the blister had become unroofed or the the top part of the skin of the blister became undone and then underneath it was just this really thick soft mushy skin that had a bad smell with some yellow drainage and so and barbara called the primary care doctor who then got me in to see you he started me on some antibiotics about six days ago and i never had any nausea or vomiting but my wife checked my temperature it was about ninety nine point seven and then at one point i had to put on an extra blanket in bed because i had some chills and when i started the antibiotics it started to feel pretty good but we've now noticed that it has turned black around the outside of the wound and i'm getting some cramping in my calf muscle as well and so there was a red streak also that was coming up the front part of my my ankle along the inside portion of my calf muscle and it's super super hot and so they wanted me to take a have have you look at it doctor okay thank you for sharing that history with me and did you complete that course of antibiotics patient i think he called in ten days' worth and i'm on day six or seven right now i know i've got about two or three days left doctor okay and you mentioned that it had some stinging and it was a bit uncomfortable are you experiencing any pain right now patient yeah it was it was stinging initially like i had just done something small but at this point it's it's really like throbbing it's almost like there is a fire poker in the bottom of my foot now and then the inside of my calf muscle is really hard and i've noticed that every time that i push that i feel it all the way up to my knee behind my kneecap and then noticed that i've been coughing a lot the last two days and then i've noticed that i've had like difficult time catching my breath when i'm walking around the house and so it's almost like two different things going on at this point doctor okay so now i see here in your record that you have some that you're diabetic and have some diabetic neuropathy as well how's your blood sugars been running i'm i'm assuming kind of all over the place over the last i'm gon na say probably three or four weeks can you tell me about that patient yeah my my a1c is six point seven it's pretty well controlled doctor okay patient i used to be on an insulin pump and i had an a1c that at one point was like thirteen but we worked with an endocrinologist to get it down to where it's at now i've been six point seven for probably two years now and i rarely have a blood sugar that goes over two hundred i check two or three times a day if i feel weird i'll check it again but i noticed my sugars have probably been trending in the three to four hundreds the last two weeks and then i had one spike at one point at like five or six hundred that got our attention and i think that's also what made my wife call the primary care doc doctor okay now i know this was caused by a new pair of shoes you had mentioned before to your pcp and he relayed this to me that you really like to go on hikes you and your wife have been hiking have you gone to the new trails that that were just opened up here behind the park patient yeah we actually hiked to charlie's bunion about a week before this i've had a new pair of diabetic shoes and inserts i get those every year i changed the inserts every three or four months i mean i've been in cruise control as far as that goes for some time i did get a new pair of shoes the prosthetist told me to check my feet every day for the first week or two which we did i did go hiking about the third or fourth day and i think that might be what caused it as i just went too far when we were hiking but yeah the trails are the trails are gorgeous they're open it's time to to be outside and i'm sorta stuck with this right now doctor absolutely yeah my wife and i like to go back there and and hike those trails as well so i'm gon na do a quick physical exam for your vital signs i do recognize a slight fever however your vitals themselves look good now on your foot exam i do recognize the necrotic wound on your heel as you mentioned it is present it's approximately two by two centimeters i i do recognize the sloughing of the of the tissue as well as what looks like cellulitis around the area as well as erythemia so now unfortunately i do also smell the odor you are correct it is it does it is odds but i do not appreciate any bony exposure now on vascular exam i do have bilateral palpable pulses femorally and popliteal pulses are present however i do n't recognize a palpable pulse dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial however i did use the doppler and they are present via doppler now i'm gon na press on the actual affected area of the wound do you have any pain there patient i do n't feel that right there doctor okay i'm gon na review the results of your right foot x-ray that we did when you came in today the good news is i do n't see any evidence of osteomyelitis meaning that there is no infection of the bone so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a pleasant age-year-old male who presents today for evaluation of a non-healing foot ulcer on his right foot. The patient reports the onset of symptoms approximately 6 weeks ago when he noted a blister on the pad of the bottom of his foot, around his heel. He initially did not think much of it and continued to walk on the front part of his foot. He eventually noticed a foul smell and his wife also noticed it, as well as the dog smelling his socks a lot. He looked at the blister and noted that the top part of the skin had come off, revealing thick, soft, mushy skin with a bad smell and yellow drainage. His primary care doctor started him on antibiotics 6 days ago, which initially made him feel better, but he has since noticed that the wound has turned black around the outside and he is experiencing cramping in his calf muscle. He also noted a red streak coming up the front part of his ankle along the inside portion of his calf muscle, which is very hot. He denies nausea or vomiting, but he did have a low-grade fever and chills at one point. He also reports a new onset of cough and shortness of breath over the past 2 days. The patient has a history of diabetes and diabetic neuropathy. His A1c is 6.7, which has been well-controlled for the past 2 years. He used to be on an insulin pump and had an A1c of 13 at one point, but he worked with an endocrinologist to get it down to its current level. He checks his blood sugar 2-3 times a day and has noticed that his sugars have been trending in the 300-400s the last 2 weeks, with one spike at 500-600. He recently went on a hike to Charlie's Bunion, which he believes may have caused the ulcer. He wears diabetic shoes and inserts, which he changes every 3-4 months. He is an avid hiker and enjoys the new trails that were recently opened behind the park. Vital signs are within normal limits except for a slight fever. Physical exam of the right foot reveals a necrotic wound on the heel, approximately 2 by 2 centimeters, with sloughing of tissue and cellulitis around the area, as well as erythema. An odor is noted from the wound. No bony exposure is appreciated. Bilateral palpable pulses are present femorally and popliteal pulses are present. Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses are not palpable, but are present via Doppler. The patient denies pain with pressure on the affected area of the wound. X-ray of the right foot reveals no evidence of osteomyelitis. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. Diabetic foot ulcer with cellulitis and necrotizing fasciitis Assessment: The patient has a non-healing diabetic foot ulcer on his right foot. The ulcer is approximately 2 x 2 cm in size and has sloughing of tissue, cellulitis, and erythema. There is also a foul odor. The patient has no palpable pulses dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial, but they are present via doppler. He also has swelling and pain in his right calf. An X-ray of the right foot shows no evidence of osteomyelitis. Plan: - Order a test to check blood supply for this wound. - Perform debridement of the ulcer in the office today. - Obtain a culture of the wound. - Continue the patient's current antibiotic therapy for 10-12 days. - Monitor the patient's blood sugars closely. - Refer the patient to an endocrinologist for follow-up of his diabetes. - See the patient again in 7 days. 2. Hypertension Assessment: The patient's blood pressure is well controlled. Plan: - Continue lisinopril 20mg Qday. Follow-up instructions: - Return to clinic in 1 week, or sooner if the wound does not improve or if he experiences worsening pain, swelling, or fever.","[{'phrase': 'months week two', 'label': 'DURATION'}, {'phrase': 'physical exam', 'label': 'DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE'}, {'phrase': 'vital signs', 'label': 'DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE'}, {'phrase': 'fever', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'vital s', 'label': 'DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE'}, {'phrase': 'foot', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'necrotic', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'wound', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'heel', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'two by two centimeters', 'label': 'DISTANCE'}, {'phrase': 'slough ing tissue', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'cellulitis', 'label': 'DISEASE_DISORDER'}, {'phrase': 'e ry th emia', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'bony exposure', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'vascular exam', 'label': 'DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE'}, {'phrase': 'bilateral', 'label': 'DETAILED_DESCRIPTION'}, {'phrase': 'palpable', 'label': 'LAB_VALUE'}, {'phrase': 'pulses', 'label': 'DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE'}, {'phrase': 'femoral ly', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'pop lite al pulses', 'label': 'DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE'}, {'phrase': 'present', 'label': 'LAB_VALUE'}, {'phrase': 'palpable', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'pulse', 'label': 'DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE'}, {'phrase': 'dorsal is pedi s', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'posterior tibial', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'do ppler', 'label': 'DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE'}, {'phrase': 'present', 'label': 'LAB_VALUE'}, {'phrase': 'do ppler', 'label': 'DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE'}, {'phrase': 'area', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'wound', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'pain', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'right foot', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'x -

"doctor: Good morning, patient. I understand you're here for a dietary consultation during your pregnancy due to gestational diabetes. patient: Yes, that's right. I had gestational diabetes with my first pregnancy and had to use insulin. I'm not really sure what ketones are. doctor: I see. Well, ketones are a type of acid that can build up in your blood when you don't have enough insulin or when your blood sugar is too high. This can be dangerous for you and your baby, so it's important to manage your blood sugar levels carefully. patient: Okay. I'll try my best. I've been walking my daughter to school and back home each day, which takes about 40 minutes total. I'm not a big milk drinker, but I do try to drink some. doctor: That's great! Exercise and a healthy diet are both important for managing gestational diabetes. I'm glad to hear you're making an effort to stay active. doctor: Let's take a look at your blood sugar records from the last week. Your fasting blood sugars have been ranging from 92 to 104, with an average of 97. Your two-hour postprandial breakfast readings have been ranging from 172 to 196, with an average of 181. Your two-hour postprandial lunch readings have been ranging from 149 to 189, with an average of 168. And your two-hour postprandial dinner readings have been ranging from 109 to 121, with an average of 116. Your overall average is 140. patient: That's a lot of numbers. What does it all mean? doctor: Well, your blood sugar levels are a bit high, which is why we need to make some adjustments to your diet and insulin regimen. I'm going to provide you with a 2300-calorie meal plan that includes three meals and three snacks per day. The snacks were added last week due to the presence of ketones in your urine. We'll also need to increase your insulin dosage. patient: Okay. I'll follow your instructions. doctor: Good. I'm also going to give you a copy of the Lily Guide for Meal Planning. This will help you make healthy choices and track your carbohydrate intake. patient: Thank you. I appreciate your help. doctor: You're welcome. I'm here to help you have a healthy pregnancy. doctor: I'd like you to work with the following meal plan with a carbohydrate budget representing approximately 45% of the calories from carbohydrates. For breakfast, you can have three carbohydrate servings. For your morning snack, you can have one carbohydrate serving. For lunch, you can have four carbohydrate servings. For your afternoon snack, you can have one carbohydrate serving. For supper, you can have four carbohydrate servings. And for your bedtime snack, you can have one carbohydrate serving. I'd also like you to include some solid protein with each of your meals as well as with the bedtime snack. You should also try to include three servings of dairy products per day to meet your nutritional needs for calcium during pregnancy. And finally, I recommend including a fruit or a vegetable with most of your meals. patient: That sounds like a lot of food! doctor: It is important to eat enough calories to support your pregnancy, but you also need to be mindful of your carbohydrate intake. That's why it's important to follow the meal plan and to test your blood sugar regularly. patient: I will. doctor: Good. I'm also going to increase your insulin dosage. In the morning, you'll take 24 units of 70/30 insulin, and in the evening, you'll take 16 units. patient: Okay. doctor: I want you to call me if your blood sugar levels are outside of the range of over 90 fasting and over 120 two-hour postprandial. patient: I will. doctor: Good. I'm confident that we can manage your gestational diabetes and help you have a healthy pregnancy. patient: Thank you. I appreciate your help.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Dietary consultation for gestational diabetes.

"doctor: Hello, Mrs. patient, I see you're here for your one-month follow-up. How have you been feeling since I last saw you? patient: I've been feeling pretty good. My knees aren't hurting me at all anymore, and I haven't needed to take any Bextra. I think the steroid injection that Dr. XYZ gave me really helped. doctor: That's great to hear. Have you been experiencing any shortness of breath, cough, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or constipation? patient: No, I haven't had any of those symptoms. My appetite is good, and I clear my plate at lunch. I haven't had any fevers, chills, or sweats either. friend: Yes, she's been doing very well. She eats excellently at lunchtime, but she continues to lose weight. doctor: I see. When I asked her what she eats for breakfast and supper, she said she doesn't really eat anything. Her only meal that she eats at the nursing home is the noon meal, and I don't think she's eating much the rest of the time. She says she's not hungry except at lunchtime. patient: That's right. I'm just not hungry the rest of the time. doctor: I understand. We did some lab work at your last visit, and your CBC, comprehensive metabolic panel, BUN, creatinine, liver enzymes, and TSH were all normal. Your free albumin was also normal at 23. I know you're on different antidepressants, and that may be causing some difficulties with unintentional weight loss. patient: Yes, I've been taking Aricept 10 mg a day, Prevacid 30 mg a day, Lexapro 10 mg a day, Norvasc 2.5 mg a day, Milk of Magnesia 30 cc daily, and Amanda 10 mg b.i.d. doctor: Okay. I've reviewed your past medical history, and it appears that you have paranoia, which is much improved on your current medications. Your social history is also unchanged. patient: Yes, that's all correct. doctor: Let's take a look at your vitals. Your weight is 123 pounds, which is down 5 pounds from last month and 11 pounds from May 2004. Your blood pressure is 128/62, your pulse is 60, your respirations are 20, and your temperature is 96.8. doctor: Your neck is supple, and your carotids are silent. Your chest is clear to auscultation, and your cardiovascular system is regular rate and rhythm. Your abdomen is soft and nontender, nondistended with positive bowel sounds. No organomegaly or masses are appreciated. Your extremities are free of edema. doctor: Based on your symptoms and examination, I've made the following assessment: 1. Unintentional weight loss. This is likely due to a lack of calorie intake, rather than a medical problem. However, your dementia may make it difficult for you to remember to eat, and your antidepressant medication may also be suppressing your appetite. 2. Depression. You are doing well on your current medications. 3. Paranoia. You are also doing well on your current medications. 4. Dementia. Your dementia is stable. 5. Osteoarthritis of the knees. Your pain is much improved. doctor: Here's my plan: 1. We will continue on your current medications. 2. I've spoken with the doctor at the hospital, and we've decided to have you eat the evening meal at the nursing home and take a supplement drink such as Ensure at breakfast time. Connie will weigh you once a week, and I will see you again in one month. If you continue to lose weight despite eating better, we will need to do further evaluation. patient: Okay, I can do that. doctor: Good. I'm glad we were able to address your concerns today. If you have any questions or problems before your next appointment, please don't hesitate to call my office.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Follow-up after steroid injection for knee pain.

doctor hi russell how are you what's been going on patient well i've been having this sharp pain on the right side of my abdomen below my ribs for the last several days doctor i saw my doctor and they ordered a cat scan and said i had a kidney stone and sent me to see a urologist okay well does the pain move or or or go anywhere or does it stay right in that same spot yeah it feels like it goes to my lower abdomen in into my groin okay and is the pain constant or does it come and go it comes and goes when it comes it's it's pretty it's pretty bad i feel like i ca n't find a comfortable position okay and do you notice any any pain when you urinate or when you pee patient yeah it kinda burns a little bit doctor okay do you notice any blood i do n't think there is any you know frank blood but the urine looks a little dark sometimes okay and what have you taken for the pain i have taken some tylenol but it has n't really helped okay and do you have any nausea vomiting any fever chills i feel nauseated but i'm not vomiting okay is anyone in your in your family had kidney stones yes my father had them and have you had kidney stones before yeah so i i've i've had them but i've been able to pass them but this is taking a lot longer okay well i'm just gon na go ahead and do a physical examination i'm gon na be calling out some of my exam findings and i'm going to explain what what those mean when i'm done okay patient okay doctor okay so on physical examination of the abdomen on a abdominal exam there is no tenderness to palpation there is no evidence of any rebound or guarding there is no peritoneal signs there is positive cva tenderness on the right flank so essentially what that means russell is that you know you have some tenderness over your over your right kidney and that just means that you might have some inflammation there so i i reviewed the results of the ct scan of your abdomen that the primary care doctor ordered and it does show a . five centimeter kidney stone located in the proximal right ureter so this the ureter is the duct in which urine passes between the kidney and the bladder there's no evidence of what we call hydronephrosis this means you know swelling of the kidney which is good means that things are still able to get through so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and my plan okay so for your first problem of this acute nephrolithiasis or kidney stone i i wan na go ahead and recommend that you push fluids to help facilitate urination and peeing to help pass the stone i'm going to prescribe oxycodone five milligrams every six to eight hours as needed for pain you can continue to alternate that with some tylenol i'm going to give you a strainer that you can use to strain your urine so that we can see it see the stone when it passes and we can send it for some some tests if that happens i'm also gon na order what we call a basic metabolic panel a urinalysis and a urine culture now i wan na see you again in one to two weeks and if you're still having symptoms we'll have to discuss further treatment such as lithotripsy which is essentially a shock wave procedure in which we sedate you and use shock waves to break up the stone to help it pass we could also do what we call a ureteroscopy which is a small telescope small camera used to go up to to the urethra and bladder and up into the ureter to retrieve the stone so let's see how you do over the next week and i want you to contact me if you're having worsening symptoms okay okay sounds good thank you,"SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Right-sided abdominal pain.

"doctor: Hello, patient. I understand you've been experiencing some health issues. Can you tell me what's been going on? patient: Well, doctor, it all started about a year and a half ago. I was walking from the bedroom to the living room when suddenly my legs gave out from under me. I felt a bit lightheaded and confused, but I was still aware of my surroundings. I managed to get up shortly after, and according to my son, I seemed to return to normal. doctor: Interesting. And since then, have you had any similar episodes? patient: Yes, unfortunately. On July 3rd, 2008, my legs gave out again, but this time without any lightheadedness. I was rushed to the hospital, where they diagnosed me with pneumonia. They said the fall was likely caused by the infection. After that, I started using a walker to get around, as I couldn't walk the two miles I used to each day. doctor: I see. So, you've had multiple falls and have been using a walker since July 2008. patient: That's right. In August of 2008, I had another fall with no lightheadedness. Pneumonia was again the culprit, and I was admitted to the hospital. After rehabilitation, I was able to use my walker again, but I never fully regained my pre-July baseline. doctor: I understand. And then in October of 2008, you had another fall, which was associated with pneumonia and shingles. patient: Yes, that's correct. I'm currently in a Chronic Rehabilitation Unit because I can no longer use a walker and rely on a wheelchair for mobility. doctor: I see. Now, you mentioned numbness in your hands. Can you tell me more about that? patient: It started about three weeks ago. My hands have been numb, involving all the fingers. I've also noticed muscle bulk loss and general weakness in my hands. However, I must say that my hand strength hasn't been normal since July 2008, but it's definitely getting worse. doctor: I see. And have you experienced any other symptoms, such as fasciculations, cramps, problems with swallowing, or breathing difficulties? patient: I have been having fasciculations in my legs, both in the lower legs and thighs, since August 2008. I don't have any cramps, swallowing problems, or breathing difficulties, though. doctor: That's good to know. How about bowel and bladder control? Any issues there? patient: I've been experiencing constipation alternating with diarrhea, but I haven't lost control of either my bowels or bladder. doctor: Okay. And you mentioned some blood pressure drops and presyncopal episodes when standing. Can you elaborate on that? patient: Yes. I've had some problems with blood pressure drops, and I do feel presyncopal when I stand. doctor: I see. And you've also noticed a loss of feeling in your feet, which have been feeling numb and sponge-like for about nine months. Is that correct? patient: That's right. Additionally, I've lost joint position sense in my feet for approximately nine months. doctor: Thank you for sharing all this information, patient. I'll need to perform a physical examination and order some tests to better understand your condition.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Evaluation of multiple falls and progressive weakness. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a pleasant age-year-old male who presents for evaluation of multiple falls and progressive weakness. The patient reports a fall one and a half years ago while walking from the bedroom to the living room. He experienced lightheadedness and confusion during the fall.

"doctor: Hello Mr./Ms. patient, I'm Dr. doctor. I understand you're here today for multiple issues. Can you tell me more about what's been going on? patient: Well, I've been having gross hematuria again. It just started out of nowhere. My Coumadin has been stopped. I also have BPH and I'm taking Flomax for that. I'm being treated with Coumadin because of atrial fibrillation and stroke. This is the second time I've had significant gross hematuria this month. doctor: I see. And you also mentioned you fell about a week ago and now you're experiencing buttock and leg pain? patient: Yes, that's right. I got x-rays of my hips, knees, and ankles, and they showed significant degenerative disease in all those areas. But there were no fractures. The pain is pretty severe, especially in the morning. patient: Oh, and my sinuses have been bothering me too. I was wondering if I could get some nasal saline spray. doctor: Sure, we can discuss that. But first, let's talk about your Coumadin and the risk of stroke in the setting of atrial fibrillation. patient: Okay. doctor: (Examines the patient's chart) Your vitals are as noted in the chart. You're alert, pleasant, and cooperative. You're not in any apparent distress and you're comfortable in a seated position. I won't be examining you further today. doctor: (Addressing the patient's concerns) For the hematuria, we need to stop the Coumadin so we can evaluate what's going on. It's probably just BPH. We'll also get a repeat UA since you mentioned some dysuria. However, I don't think that would account for the gross hematuria. We'll start you on aspirin 81 mg once a day by mouth. doctor: For the pain, we'll try you on Lortab. You'll get one Lortab 5/500 mg every morning before getting out of bed. You can have a few more throughout the day if you need them. doctor: We'll also see about setting you up with massage therapy and/or physical therapy for your back pain. doctor: And for your sinuses, we'll arrange for you to have saline nasal spray at the bedside for use as needed. patient: Okay, that sounds good. Thank you, Dr. doctor. doctor: You're welcome. If you have any other questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Gross hematuria. Buttock and leg pain.

"doctor: Hello, Ms. Connor. I see you're here for a wound check. How are you doing today? patient: I'm doing well, doctor. My wound has healed nicely, and I'm having good ostomy output. I do have some intermittent pain beneath the upper portion of the incision and in the right lower quadrant below my ostomy. It's not constant, but it can be quite bothersome at times. doctor: I see. And what have you been doing to manage the pain? patient: I've been taking Percocet, which works well. But I ran out, and I've been trying extra strength Tylenol, which sometimes helps. doctor: Okay. Well, I can give you a refill for the Percocet, but I want you to start weaning yourself off of it. I'd like you to try taking ibuprofen or Tylenol first, and only take the Percocet if the pain is severe. patient: Okay, I can do that. doctor: Good. Now, I also want to talk to you about your diet. You mentioned that you've been having some questions about what you can and cannot eat with your ileostomy. patient: Yes, that's right. I'm not sure what foods are safe to eat and which ones to avoid. doctor: Well, there are a few things you should keep in mind. First, you should avoid foods that are high in fiber, such as fruits and vegetables. These foods can cause diarrhea and cramping. You should also avoid foods that are high in fat, such as fried foods and fatty meats. These foods can slow down digestion and cause constipation. patient: I see. So, what can I eat? doctor: There are plenty of foods that you can eat. You can eat bananas, rice, toast, cheese, and peanut butter. These foods are all low in fiber and fat, and they're easy to digest. You can also eat lean meats, fish, and eggs. Just be sure to cook them thoroughly. patient: Okay, that sounds doable. doctor: Good. I'm also going to give you a list of foods to avoid. Please be sure to read it carefully. patient: I will. doctor: Now, I also want to talk to you about the numbness in your right hand and arm. This is likely due to positioning during surgery. It should continue to improve over time. In the meantime, you can do some hand exercises to help speed up the recovery. patient: Okay, I'll do that. doctor: Good. Well, I think that covers everything. I'm happy to see that you're healing well from your surgery. I'll see you back in six months for a routine checkup. patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Follow-up visit for wound check after ostomy surgery. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a pleasant female who presents for a wound check after ostomy surgery. She reports having good ostomy output and that her wound has healed nicely. However, she has been experiencing intermittent pain beneath the upper portion of the incision and in the right lower quadrant below her ostomy. The pain is not constant but can be quite bothersome at times. She has been taking Percocet for the pain, which has been effective, but she ran out and has been trying extra strength Tylenol, which has sometimes helped. The patient also has numbness in her right hand and arm, which she attributes to positioning during surgery. She is otherwise doing well. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. Right lower quadrant abdominal pain Assessment: The patient has right lower quadrant abdominal pain, which is intermittent and sometimes severe. This pain may be due to surgical incisional pain or a possible internal hernia. Plan: - Will obtain a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis to rule out an internal hernia. - If CT scan is negative, will refer to pain management for further evaluation and treatment. 2. Ileostomy dietary management Assessment: The patient has an ileostomy and is unsure about what foods to eat and avoid. Plan: - Provided the patient with a list of foods to avoid and foods that are safe to eat. - Recommended a gradual transition to a low-fiber, low-fat diet. - Referred to a registered dietitian for further dietary counseling. 3. Right hand and arm numbness Assessment: The patient has numbness in the right hand and arm, likely due to positioning during surgery. Plan: - Recommended hand exercises to help speed up recovery. - Reassured the patient that the numbness should improve over time. Follow-up instructions: - Return to clinic in six months for a routine checkup. - Contact the clinic if the abdominal pain worsens, if the numbness in the right hand and arm does not improve, or if any new symptoms develop.","[{'phrase': ' ostomy output', 'label': 'DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE'}, {'phrase': 'pain', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'beneath', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'upper portion of the incision', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'right lower quadrant below my  ostomy', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'Percocet', 'label': 'MEDICATION'}, {'phrase': 'extra strength', 'label': 'DETAILED_DESCRIPTION'}, {'phrase': 'Tylenol', 'label': 'MEDICATION'}, {'phrase': 'Percocet', 'label': 'MEDICATION'}, {'phrase': 'ibuprofen', 'label': 'MEDICATION'}, {'phrase': 'Tylenol', 'label': 'MEDICATION'}, {'phrase': 'fiber', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'fruits', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'vegetables', 'label': 'DETAILED_DESCRIPTION'}, {'phrase': 'diarrhea', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'cramping', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'fat', 'label': 'DETAILED_DESCRIPTION'}, {'phrase': 'fried', 'label': 'DETAILED_DESCRIPTION'}, {'phrase': 'fatty meats', 'label': 'DETAILED_DESCRIPTION'}, {'phrase': 'constipation', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'bananas rice toast cheese peanut butter', 'label': 'DETAILED_DESCRIPTION'}, {'phrase': 'lean meats', 'label': 'DETAILED_DESCRIPTION'}, {'phrase': 'fish', 'label': 'DETAILED_DESCRIPTION'}, {'phrase': 'eggs', 'label': 'DETAILED_DESCRIPTION'}, {'phrase': 'numbness', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'right hand', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'arm', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'hand', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'exercises', 'label': 'THERAPEUTIC_PROCEDURE'}, {'phrase': 'six months', 'label': 'DATE'}]","[{'phrase': ' ostomy output', 'label': 'DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE'}, {'phrase': 'pain', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'beneath', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'upper portion of the incision', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'right lower quadrant below my  ostomy', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'Percocet', 'label': 'MEDICATION'}, {'phrase': 'extra strength', 'label': 'DETAILED_DESCRIPTION'}, {'phrase': 'Tylenol', 'label': 'MEDICATION'}, {'phrase': 'ibuprofen', 'label': 'MEDICATION'}, {'phrase': 'fiber', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'fruits', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'vegetables', 'label': 'DETAILED_DESCRIPTION'}, {'phrase': 'diarrhea', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'cramping', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'fat', 'label': 'DETAILED_DESCRIPTION'}, {'phrase': 'fried', 'label': 'DETAILED_DESCRIPTION'}, {'phrase': 'fatty meats', 'label': 'DETAILED_DESCRIPTION'}, {'phrase': 'constipation', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'bananas rice toast cheese peanut butter', 'label': 'DETAILED_DESCRIPTION'}, {'phrase': 'lean meats', 'label': 'DETAILED_DESCRIPTION'}, {'phrase': 'fish', 'label': 'DETAILED_DESCRIPTION'}, {'phrase': 'eggs', 'label': 'DETAILED_DESCRIPTION'}, {'phrase': 'numbness', 'label': 'SIGN_SYMPTOM'}, {'phrase': 'right hand', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'arm', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'hand', 'label': 'BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE'}, {'phrase': 'exercises', 'label': 'THERAPEUTIC_PROCEDURE'}, {'phrase': 'six months', 'label': 'DATE'}]","[' ostomy output', 'pain', 'beneath', 'upper portion of the incision', 'right lower quadrant below my  ostomy', 'Percocet', 'extra strength', 'Tylenol', 'Percocet', 'ibuprofen', 'Tylenol', 'fiber', 'fruits', 'vegetables', 'diarrhea', 'cramping', 'fat', 'fried', 'fatty meats', 'constipation', 'bananas rice toast cheese peanut butter', 'lean meats', 'fish', 'eggs', 'numbness', 'right hand', 'arm', 'hand', 'exercises', 'six months']","[' ostomy output', 'pain', 'beneath', 'upper portion of the incision', 'right lower quadrant below my  ostomy', 'Percocet', 'extra strength', 'Tylenol', 'ibuprofen', 'fiber', 'fruits', 'vegetables', 'diarrhea', 'cramping', 'fat', 'fried', 'fatty meats', 'constipation', 'bananas rice toast cheese peanut butter', 'lean meats', 'fish', 'eggs', 'numbness', 'right hand', 'arm', 'hand', 'exercises', 'six months']"
"doctor: Hello, patient, I see you're here today for a follow-up appointment. How are you doing? patient: I'm doing okay, Doctor. I'm still a little tired, but I'm managing. doctor: I'm glad to hear that. Let's talk about your kidney disease. You were diagnosed with parenchymal disease in 2002, is that right? patient: Yes, that's right. doctor: And you've been seeing Dr. Xyz for your care? patient: Yes, I have. doctor: He told me that you've been having some problems with your creatinine levels. patient: Yes, they've been going up. doctor: I see. And you're not on a renal diet yet? patient: No, I'm not. doctor: Okay. Well, I think it's time we start thinking about that. A renal diet can help to slow the progression of your kidney disease. patient: I'm not sure I'm ready for that. doctor: I understand. It's a big change. But it's important to think about your long-term health. patient: I know. doctor: We can talk more about it at your next appointment. In the meantime, I want you to start keeping a food diary. Write down everything you eat and drink, and how much. This will help us to see if there are any foods that are causing your creatinine levels to go up. patient: Okay, I will. doctor: Good. And I want you to keep up with your medications. Are you still taking your Procrit and Renagel? patient: Yes, I am. doctor: Good. Those medications are important for helping to control your anemia and your kidney disease. patient: I know. doctor: I also want you to start exercising regularly. Exercise can help to improve your overall health and well-being, and it may also help to slow the progression of your kidney disease. patient: I used to exercise vigorously, but I've stopped at this time. doctor: I understand. But even a little bit of exercise is better than none. Start by walking for 30 minutes three times a week. patient: I'll try. doctor: Good. I'm also going to refer you to a dietitian. She can help you to create a renal diet that meets your individual needs. patient: Okay. doctor: And finally, I want you to see me back in three months for a follow-up appointment. We'll check your creatinine levels again and see how you're doing. patient: Okay, I will. doctor: Good.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a pleasant 65-year-old female who presents for an evaluation of long-standing iron deficiency anemia. She reports being diagnosed with anemia in 12-2019 and was unable to donate blood. Her follow-up blood work on 01/20/20 revealed a low hemoglobin, stable hematocrit, and normal iron labs, although ferritin was low. She was taking ferrous sulfate, three hundred, twenty-five milligrams by mouth. The patient reports feeling fatigued during the day and experiences fevers with chills at times. She also notes dyspnea on exertion, headaches, cold sensitivity, anxiety, and depression. She had a hysterectomy in 1996, and her last colonoscopy was about five to six years ago, which was relatively normal. She denies a history of heavy periods, alcohol use, or use of oxygen at night. She takes over-the-counter vitamin B12 and recently started taking her iron pills again, one in the morning and one in the evening. The patient has been instructed to continue each dose with vitamin C found in orange juice for the next 12 weeks, then recheck the CBC, iron, ferritin, B12, and folate. A referral was sent to her hematologist. The plan is for an EGD and a colonoscopy to assess for potential sources of anemia or GI bleed. If this is inconclusive, capsule endoscopy will be considered. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. Iron deficiency anemia Assessment: Patient has long-standing iron deficiency anemia, with low hemoglobin and low ferritin.

I'm here to talk to you about your heart condition and the recent fall you had. patient: Hello, Dr. doctor. doctor: I understand you had a fall yesterday and hit your left side on a rock. You were brought to the emergency room and found to have a rapid atrial tachyarrhythmia. You were started on Cardizem, but it was stopped because your heart rate dropped into the 50s. patient: Yes, that's right. doctor: I've reviewed your EKGs, and they show multifocal atrial tachycardia, which is a type of irregular heartbeat that starts in multiple areas of the atria, the upper chambers of your heart. However, your most recent EKG this morning shows normal sinus rhythm with frequent atrial premature contractions (APCs). Your potassium level is now 3.7, which is within the normal range. patient: I do recall having palpitations after the fall, but they've gone away since then. I haven't had any chest pain or shortness of breath before or since the fall. doctor: That's good to hear. You mentioned you can walk and climb two flights of stairs without problems. patient: Yes, that's correct. doctor: I've also reviewed your medical history. You have a history of hypertension, severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild pulmonary hypertension, and mild aortic stenosis.

"doctor: Good morning, Ms. ABC. Thank you for coming in today. I understand you're here for a follow-up regarding your cervical spinal stenosis. patient: Yes, that's right. doctor: Okay. Let's start by talking about your symptoms. You mentioned that you've been having right upper extremity pain, paresthesias, and weakness. Can you tell me a little bit more about that? patient: Sure. The pain is mostly in my right arm and hand. It's a sharp, shooting pain that sometimes radiates down my arm. The paresthesias are like tingling and numbness. And the weakness is mostly in my right hand. I have a hard time opening jars and doors, and I often drop things. doctor: I see. And have you noticed any other symptoms, such as bowel or bladder dysfunction, lower back pain, or lower extremity pain? patient: No, I haven't had any of those symptoms. doctor: Okay. That's good to hear. I'd also like to ask you about your sleep. Have you been having any trouble sleeping? patient: Yes, actually. I've been having some sharp, shooting pain and weakness down my left upper extremity when I'm sleeping. It's really scary. doctor: I understand. That must be very difficult. patient: It is. doctor: Well, I'm glad you came in today so we can talk about this. I've reviewed your medical records, including your cervical spine MRI and radiographs. Based on your history, physical examination, and radiographic findings, it appears that you have C4-5, C5-6 cervical spinal stenosis with associated right greater than left upper extremity radiculopathy. patient: What does that mean? doctor: It means that the spinal canal in your neck is narrowed, which is putting pressure on your spinal cord and nerve roots. This can cause pain, weakness, and paresthesias in your arms and hands. patient: I see. doctor: I've discussed the diagnosis, prognosis, natural history, nonoperative, and operative treatment options with you today. We can continue with nonoperative management, such as physical therapy, or we can add cervical epidural steroid injections. We can also consider surgical intervention. patient: I'm not sure what to do. doctor: I understand. It's a big decision. I want to make sure you have all the information you need to make an informed choice. patient: Okay. doctor: Well, let's talk about the surgical option in more detail. The procedure would involve C4-5, C5-6 anterior cervical decompression and fusion. This would involve removing the bone and tissue that is compressing your spinal cord and nerve roots, and then fusing the vertebrae together to stabilize the spine. patient: What are the risks of surgery? doctor: There are some risks associated with surgery, including bleeding, infection, neurovascular injury, dural tear, singular or multiple muscle weakness, paralysis, hoarseness of voice, difficulty swallowing, pseudoarthrosis, adjacent segment disease, and the risk of this given your relatively young age. patient: That's a lot to consider. doctor: I know it is. But I want you to know that I'm confident that this surgery can help to improve your symptoms. patient: I appreciate that. doctor: You're welcome. I also want to discuss the option of disk arthroplasty. This is a newer procedure that involves replacing the damaged disk with an artificial disk. This can help to preserve motion in the spine. patient: That sounds interesting. doctor: It is. But it's important to note that disk arthroplasty is not always successful. And it's not clear whether it's better than traditional surgery in the long run. patient: I see. doctor: So, ultimately, the decision of whether or not to have surgery is up to you. I'm here to answer any questions you have and to help you make the best decision for your health. patient: Thank you. I appreciate that. doctor: You're welcome. So, what are your thoughts? patient: I think I'd like to proceed with the surgery. doctor: Okay. I'm glad to hear that. We'll schedule your surgery for August 1st. In the meantime, you'll need to complete some preoperative testing. patient: Okay. I'll do that. doctor: Good. I'm confident that this surgery will help you to get back to your old self. patient: Thank you. I hope so too.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Follow-up regarding cervical spinal stenosis.

"doctor: Good morning, Mr. Sample. How are you doing today? patient: I'm doing okay, doctor. I'm here today because I've been having some problems with snoring and sleep apnea. doctor: I see.

Well, I think we should do a sleep study to see if you have obstructive sleep apnea. patient: What's that? doctor: It's a test that we do to measure your breathing and oxygen levels while you sleep. It will help us determine if you have sleep apnea and, if so, how severe it is. patient: Okay. When can we do that? doctor: We can schedule it for next week. In the meantime, I want you to try to lose some weight. Even a small amount of weight loss can make a big difference in your symptoms. patient: I'll try, doctor. doctor: I also want you to get your thyroid levels checked. Sleep apnea can sometimes be caused by an underactive thyroid. patient: Okay. doctor: And finally, I want you to avoid driving or doing anything else that could be dangerous if you fall asleep. patient: I will. doctor: Good.

"doctor: Good morning, Mr. Smith. I understand you've been experiencing a decreased level of consciousness. Can you tell me a little bit about what's been going on? patient: Well, I'm not really sure. I've been feeling really tired and weak for the past day or so. I fell out of my wheelchair the other night and got some cuts on my face. My wife called the ambulance because she found me unresponsive this morning. doctor: I see. Do you remember taking any medication recently? patient: I think I took my Xanax last night, but I'm not sure. My wife said I took a whole milligram instead of the usual 0.125 milligrams. doctor: That could be the cause of your decreased consciousness.

"doctor: Hello patient, I'm Dr. doctor, and I'll be your doctor today. What brings you in? patient: I've been having chronic ear infections since I was born. I've had about 6 bouts of otitis media, and I've been taking antibiotics for them. I also have chronic nasal congestion. doctor: I see. Have you ever had any spontaneous tympanic membrane perforations? patient: No, I haven't. But I have had fevers up to 102 degrees during the acute infections. doctor: Okay. So, we're going to admit you to the hospital today for a myringotomy and tube insertion under general facemask anesthesia. patient: What's that? doctor: It's a surgical procedure where we make a small incision in your eardrum and insert a tiny tube. This will help to drain the fluid from your middle ear and prevent future infections. patient: Okay. doctor: I'm also going to prescribe you some antibiotics to take after the surgery. patient: How long will I have to stay in the hospital? doctor: You'll probably be able to go home the same day. patient: That's a relief. doctor: I know this can be a scary time, but I want to assure you that we're going to take good care of you. patient: Thank you, doctor. doctor: You're welcome. Now, I'm going to examine your ears, nose, and throat. doctor: (Examines patient's ears, nose, and throat) doctor: Your right eardrum is retracted and poorly mobile, and there's a middle ear effusion present. Your left ear is still a little bit black. Your nose has moderate inferior turbinate hypertrophy, but no polyps or purulence. Your oral cavity and oropharynx have 2+ tonsils, but no exudates. Your neck is clear of nodes, masses, or thyromegaly. Your lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion. Your cardiac exam shows a regular rate and rhythm, with no murmurs. Your abdomen is soft and nontender, with positive bowel sounds. doctor: Based on my examination and your history, I'm diagnosing you with chronic eustachian tube dysfunction, chronic otitis media with effusion, recurrent acute otitis media, and wax accumulation. patient: What does that mean? doctor: It means that your eustachian tubes, which are the tubes that connect your middle ear to your throat, are not working properly. This is causing fluid to build up in your middle ear, which is leading to infections. The wax accumulation is also contributing to the problem. patient: What can we do about it? doctor: As I mentioned, we're going to do a myringotomy and tube insertion. This will help to drain the fluid from your middle ear and prevent future infections. We're also going to give you antibiotics to treat the current infection. patient: Okay. doctor: I know this is a lot to take in, but I'm here to answer any questions you have. patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate it.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Chronic ear infections and chronic nasal congestion.

"doctor: Good morning, Mrs. patient, I understand you're here today for a follow-up on your hypertension. patient: That's right, doctor. My blood pressure has been going up lately, and I'm worried about it. doctor: I see. Can you tell me more about what you've been experiencing? patient: Well, I've had high blood pressure for about 15 years now. It's been stable for the past 12-15 years on 10 mg of lisinopril. But in August of 2007, I started treatment with doxorubicin and Procrit, and my blood pressure started to go up over 200. My doctor increased my lisinopril to 40 mg daily, and two weeks ago, after I visited the emergency room with high blood pressure, they added metoprolol and HCTZ. doctor: I see. And are you having any other symptoms besides the high blood pressure? patient: No, not really. I feel fine. doctor: That's good to hear. I'm going to examine you now and then we'll talk about some next steps. doctor: (Examines the patient) Your blood pressure today is 182/78. Your lungs are clear, and there's no abdominal bruit. You do have 1+ edema bilaterally. patient: Oh, that's probably from the Procrit. doctor: It's possible. I'm also going to order some lab tests, including a urinalysis, creatinine, and an SMA7. patient: Okay. doctor: (After reviewing the lab results) Your urinalysis shows 1+ proteinuria, and your creatinine is 0.8. Your renal ultrasound showed possible renal artery stenosis and a 2 cm cyst in the left kidney. However, the MRA of the renal arteries was essentially unremarkable, with no suspicion for renal artery stenosis. patient: So, what does that mean? doctor: Well, it means that we can't find a clear-cut etiology for your recent worsening hypertension. The MRA ruled out renal artery stenosis, so I'm thinking that the Procrit initiation and possible fluid retention may be the cause. patient: I see. doctor: I'm going to start you on hydrochlorothiazide 24 mg daily. I'm also going to give you a sample of Tekturna, which may help to lower your systolic blood pressure. I want you to stick with your salt intake and report back to me in 10 days with your blood pressure results. You'll also need to repeat an SMA7 to rule out possible hyperkalemia due to Tekturna. patient: Okay, I will. Thank you, doctor.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Follow-up on hypertension. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a pleasant age-year-old female who presents for follow-up on hypertension. She reports her blood pressure has been elevated recently. She has had hypertension for about 15 years, which was stable for the past 12-15 years on 10 mg of lisinopril.

"doctor: Good morning, Mr. Patient. Thank you for coming in today. I understand you've been having some bleeding from your right AKA stump and penile discharge. patient: That's right, doctor. I was recently discharged from the hospital after being admitted for altered mental status and before that after undergoing right above knee amputation for wet gangrene. I was transferred to a nursing home, and when I started bleeding from my stump yesterday, they brought me back to the ED. doctor: I see. And you mentioned you also have penile discharge? patient: Yes, that's right. I noticed it when they were placing a catheter in the ED. The doctor said my glans appeared infected, so he called for a urology consult. doctor: Okay, I'll take a look. (Examines the patient's penis) I see what you mean. The glans tip is pale-looking with areas of yellow-white tissue. The proximal glans appears pink. There's no purulent discharge on compression of the glans, but it's slightly tender to the touch. patient: It's been bothering me quite a bit. doctor: I understand. I think it's likely due to chronic ischemic changes, given your history of peripheral vascular disease and multiple catheterizations. patient: Is there anything we can do about it? doctor: Yes, there are a few things. First, we'll remove the Foley catheter. We'll also start you on local hygiene and apply bacitracin ointment to the area. I'm also going to prescribe an antibiotic for a urinary tract infection. patient: Okay, that sounds good. doctor: I want you to follow up with me as needed.

doctor hey linda good to see you today so looking here in my notes looks like you you think you have a kidney stone think you've had them before and and you i guess you're having some pain and while we are here i see you i see you have a you have past medical history of hypertension diabetes and we will check up on those as well so with your kidney stone can you tell me what happened what's going on patient and i've been in a lot of pain it started about i would say probably about three days ago doctor okay patient started having pain on my left back doctor okay patient and since then i continued to have pain it is traveling a little lower it's gotten little low but i definitely have not passed it yet and i'm just in so much pain doctor okay so is the pain that you're having is it constant or does it come and go patient it's constant doctor okay patient all the time i ca n't get comfortable doctor alright are you able to urinate patient i am and this morning i actually started seeing some blood doctor okay yeah so and i know you said i see you've had some kidney stones in the past like how many times would you say you've had one of these episodes patient i've had it for probably this might be my third time doctor third time alright patient yeah i have n't had one in a while but yeah this is my third time doctor okay so have you noticed any nausea chills fever patient no fever some chills and i i just in so much pain i i ca n't eat and i do feel a little nauseous doctor okay that sound definitely understandable so you've been in a lot of pain so have you tried to take any medications to alleviate the pain patient yeah i've been taking tylenol i have had to try some ibuprofen i know you said to be careful with my blood pressure but i have been trying to do that because i'm just in so much pain and it's not really working doctor okay and before what would you how long would you say it took you to pass the other stones or how was that that resolved patient yeah usually usually about about three four days to pass it yeah doctor right so this is this is the looks like this is the third day patient yeah doctor so we are getting close there patient okay doctor yeah so hopefully we can pass it but we'll i'll definitely we can take a look at it here in a second so while you are here i also wanted to check up on your your diabetes and and hypertension you have so i'm looking here at my notes and you're on two . five of norvasc for your high blood pressure when you came in today your blood pressure was a was a little bit high and i know that's probably because you are in a bunch of pain so that definitely makes sense but i think last time we talked a little bit about you getting a blood pressure cuff and taking your blood pressures regularly so those readings first off were you able to get the blood pressure cuff patient i was i have n't been great about taking it but i did get the blood pressure cuff doctor so the time that you did take it and i think that's something we got to work on is you've taken them i think at least three times a week i would like you to what have those been running patient like the top numbers they're usually the one thirties sometimes i get i do go into one forties and once it went to like one fifty doctor okay patient and then the bottom number has been between seventy and eighty okay that i mean that's not too bad i think when you were first diagnosed you were up there in the doctor the one eighties which was really high patient right doctor so let me talk a little bit also about you trying to lower your salt intake to like like twenty three hundred milligrams a a day so have you been able to do that patient trying my best but doc i really like my french fries doctor yeah patient like doctor we we all like we all like the french fries you know but you know we we we we also do n't like strokes so we do n't want to have a scope and all the all the french fries so that's something definitely i would like you to work on and do you think you'd be able to to curb that french fry habit or that bad this bad food habits by yourself or do you think you need help patient yeah some help could be helpful okay yeah we can definitely get you connected with someone just to help you with your diet kinda that's the biggest thing for a lot of my patient is trying to control that diet alright doctor so i also want to take a look here at your diabetes and last time you came in your a1c was a little bit higher at seven . three and you're on five hundred of metformin currently so have you been taking your blood sugars before you eat everyday patient i have and those those have been pretty good they are like in the low one hundreds doctor okay that that that's definitely good because when you came in i think we did a glucose test on you couple of months ago and you were around three hundred which is which is pretty up there so i'm glad that you know those levels are down and have you been taking that metformin everyday patient i do doctor okay patient i do take it doctor that that that that's really good alright so let me do a quick physical exam on you just a couple of questions before i take a look at your your abdomen and and your back talked to take a look at that that kidney stones you're having so i just want to make sure are you having any any chest pain patient no chest pain doctor no chest pain are you having any belly pain patient the back pain is starting to kind of go down into my groin but i would n't say any back pain i mean abdominal pain doctor no abdominal pain alright so let me check here i'm gon na listen to your heart real quick and so on your heart exam i do hear a grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur and that we knew about that already so not really worried about that currently listen to your lungs your lungs are clear bilaterally i do n't hear any crackles or wheezes so let me press here on your abdomen does that hurt patient yes doctor okay i'm gon na press here on your back is that painful patient yes doctor alright so on your examination of your abdomen there is tenderness to palpation of the abdomen there is n't any rebound or guarding though and only there is also cva tinnitus on the right on your on your flank as well and so it seems to me you know that you do have that kidney stone looks like you do have some inflammation around your kidney that's what that that's that tenderness around your cva is is telling me so let's go talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you know right now because of your history of of having kidney stones you you do have a kidney stone so what we're gon na do is first off i'm gon na get you some pain medication kinda you're in a ton of pain right now i'm gon na prescribe you some oxycodone five milligrams you can take that every six to eight hours as needed for pain and so hopefully that can help you feeling better and you can continue to take that tylenol for any breakthrough pain that you're having i do wan na make sure that you're pushing fluids right now because we need to try to push that stone out that you're having just kinda clear your kidneys and that that would definitely help i also want to give you a strainer so you can strain your urine to see if you do actually pass that stone and then i'm going to refer you to urology and we're actually i'm gon na have you you even if you pass a stone in the next couple of days i want you to go anyway because it seems like you're having recurrent kidney stones and so hopefully they can help do something to to help this from happening in the future for your hypertension i'm gon na keep you on that two . five norvasc your your blood pressures look good so i'm not gon na make any changes there and then for your diabetes we'll keep you on the five hundred of metformin and i also want to give you a referral to nutrition to a dietitian and they will be able to help you with your your diet i know you said you have a few issues so you know they can possibly write a diet for you and if you follow it you know hopefully in the future we can get you off of both of these medications and get you back to normal so how does that all sound patient that sounds good and i i just i just want this pain to go away so thank you doctor okay no problem,"SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Left-sided

"doctor: Good morning, Mr./Ms. patient. I understand you're here today because you're experiencing some joint pain and swelling. Can you tell me more about what's been going on? patient: Sure. I've been having pain in my right and left hands for about two weeks now. It started out as just a dull ache, but it's gotten worse over time. Now, it's hard to do everyday things like open a jar or type on a keyboard. doctor: I see. Have you noticed any swelling or stiffness in your joints? patient: Yes, my hands have been swollen and stiff, especially in the morning. It's hard to move them at first, but it usually gets better as the day goes on. doctor: Have you had any other symptoms, like fever, fatigue, or weight loss? patient: No, I haven't had any of those symptoms. doctor: Okay. Do you have any history of rheumatoid arthritis in your family? patient: Yes, my maternal grandmother had rheumatoid arthritis. doctor: That's helpful to know. I'm going to order some blood tests to check for rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory conditions. I'll also have you come back to the clinic in two weeks so we can review the results and discuss treatment options. patient: Okay, thank you. doctor: You're welcome. I'm here if you have any questions. The doctor orders blood tests for rheumatoid factor, sed rate, and C4 complement. Two weeks later, the patient returns to the clinic. doctor: Hello again, Mr./Ms. patient. I have the results of your blood tests. patient: Okay. What did they show? doctor: Your rheumatoid factor is elevated at 52 U/ml, your sed rate is elevated at 31 mm/hr, and your C4 complement is low at 19 mg/dl. These results, along with your symptoms and family history, suggest that you have rheumatoid arthritis. patient: I see. What does that mean? doctor: Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic autoimmune disease that causes inflammation in the joints. It can lead to pain, swelling, and stiffness. It can also affect other organs in the body, such as the heart, lungs, and kidneys. patient: That sounds serious. Is there anything I can do to treat it? doctor: There are a number of medications that can help to control the inflammation and slow the progression of the disease. We'll start you on a medication called Vioxx. It's a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can help to reduce pain and swelling. I'm also going to recommend that you see a physical therapist to help you manage your symptoms and improve your range of motion. patient: Okay. I'll do that. doctor: I'm going to have you come back to the clinic in six weeks so we can check on your progress. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to call my office. patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Joint pain and swelling.

I've been feeling short of breath and tired for the past few weeks. I also have chest pain that feels like a dull ache in my chest. It's not related to any specific activity or exertion, and there's nothing that seems to make it better or worse. doctor: I see. Have you had any other symptoms, like lightheadedness, dizziness, or fainting? patient: No, I haven't had any of those symptoms. My activity level has been pretty stable, but I do have a low-grade fever that I've noticed over the past few weeks. doctor: Okay. I'd like to do a few tests to try to figure out what's causing your symptoms. We'll start with a blood test and a chest X-ray. patient: Sure, I'm happy to do that. doctor: (After reviewing the test results) Your blood test shows that you have an elevated white blood cell count, which could be a sign of an infection. Your chest X-ray shows that you have a pericardial effusion, which is a buildup of fluid around your heart. patient: What does that mean? doctor: It means that the sac around your heart is filled with fluid. This can put pressure on your heart and make it difficult to pump blood. In some cases, it can also lead to shortness of breath and chest pain. patient: Is it serious? doctor: It can be, but it depends on the underlying cause. In your case, the effusion appears to be chronic, which means it's been there for a while. We'll need to do some more tests to try to figure out what's causing it. patient: What kind of tests? doctor: We'll start with an echocardiogram, which is an ultrasound of your heart. That will help us get a better look at the effusion and see if it's causing any problems with your heart function. We may also need to do a biopsy of the pericardium, which is the sac around your heart. patient: Okay. I'm a little nervous, but I'll do whatever it takes to get better. doctor: I understand. We'll take good care of you. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe some antibiotics to treat the infection. I also want you to follow up with me in a few weeks so we can review the results of your tests and discuss next steps. patient: Thank you, doctor.

"doctor: Hello, patient's mother. I'm Dr. doctor, and I'm here to see patient today. patient's mother: Hi, Dr. doctor. Thank you for seeing us. doctor: So, patient had a circumcision a few days ago, and now he's developed some swelling and fever. Can you tell me more about that? patient's mother: Sure. He had a newborn circumcision when he was about a week old, but it didn't go well. He developed a concealed or buried penis, with extra skin and tightness. So, he had a second circumcision with a general anesthetic about 8 or 9 days ago. doctor: I see. And when did the swelling and fever start? patient's mother: It started on Thursday. He had fairly significant swelling in his penis, scrotum, and suprapubic region. He also had a purulent discharge and a fever of 102 to 103 degrees Fahrenheit. doctor: Okay. And when did you bring him to the hospital? patient's mother: We brought him to the hospital on Thursday. He was transferred to Children's Hospital for further care. doctor: I see. And what have the doctors been doing to treat him? patient's mother: They've been giving him clindamycin, and he's now afebrile and showing marked improvement. doctor: That's good to hear. I was requested to consult on his case because of the appearance of his penis. Can I take a look? patient's mother: Sure. doctor: (Examines patient's penis) Okay. I see that he has a buried appearance of the penis after the recent circumcision, with a normal-appearing glans. The tissue itself is quite dull and soft or readily retractable at this time. The scrotum is normal, and there's no erythema or tenderness. Both testes are descended without hydroceles. doctor: I think that the swelling is a mixture of the resolving cellulitis and a suprapubic fat pad. I'm going to recommend that he be treated with Bactrim for a 10-day course at home, bacitracin, or some antibiotics ointment to the penis with each diaper change for the next 2 to 3 weeks, and sitz baths once or twice a day. patient's mother: Okay. I'll do that. doctor: I also want to talk to you about the importance of gently retracting the skin to keep it from adhering again. Because of the prominent suprapubic fat pad, it's more likely to adhere again. patient's mother: I understand. I'll be sure to do that. doctor: Good. I think that patient is going to be just fine. He has a scheduled follow-up appointment with his urologist. He should keep that appointment or follow up sooner if there are any other problems. patient's mother: Thank you, Dr. doctor. I appreciate your help. doctor: You're welcome. I'm glad I could help.","SUBJECTIVE CHIEF COMPLAINT Swelling and fever after circumcision.

"doctor: Hello Mr. ABCD, I'm Dr. doctor, the oncologist that you'll be seeing today. I understand that you've been diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer. I'm sorry to hear that. patient: Thank you, Doctor. It's been a tough few weeks. doctor: I can imagine. Can you tell me a little bit about your symptoms? patient: Well, it all started about two months ago. I started having some pain in my left flank. I didn't think much of it at first, but it gradually got worse. Eventually, I went to the emergency room, and they did a CT scan. That's when they found the mass in my adrenal gland. doctor: I see. And since then, you've been transferred here to XYZ Hospital for further evaluation? patient: Yes, that's right. doctor: I've reviewed your medical records, and I see that you've had a CT scan of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis. The results showed a mass in your right paratracheal region, as well as several other suspicious lesions. patient: So, what does that mean? doctor: Well, it means that the cancer has spread to other parts of your body. This is what we call metastatic cancer. patient: (Sighs) I see. doctor: I know this is a lot to take in. I'm here to answer any questions you have. patient: Thank you. I appreciate that. doctor: You're welcome. So, what are your main concerns right now? patient: Well, I'm worried about whether this is curable. doctor: I understand. Unfortunately, metastatic lung cancer is not curable. However, it is treatable. patient: (Sighs) I see. doctor: I know this is difficult news to hear. But I want to assure you that we're going to do everything we can to help you. patient: Thank you. I appreciate that. doctor: You're welcome. So, let's talk about your treatment options. patient: Okay. doctor: The main treatment for metastatic lung cancer is chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is a type of medication that kills cancer cells. patient: I've heard of chemotherapy. doctor: Yes, it's a common treatment for cancer. Chemotherapy can be given in a variety of ways, but the most common way is through an IV. patient: Okay. doctor: Chemotherapy can have side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, hair loss, and fatigue. But these side effects can be managed. patient: I see. doctor: I would also like to order a PET-CT scan to get a better picture of the extent of your cancer. patient: Okay. doctor: I know this is a lot to take in. But I want you to know that we're here to help you. patient: Thank you. I appreciate that. doctor: You're welcome. So, do you have any other questions for me today? patient: No, I think that's all for now. doctor: Okay. Well, I'm going to go ahead and schedule your chemotherapy treatments. We'll start as soon as possible. patient: Thank you. doctor: You're welcome. I'll also give you a prescription for pain medication. patient: Thank you. doctor: You're welcome.
